  party_1_text_desc:0 "§LFounded in 1905 by popular figures like §YJean Jaurès§!, §YJules Guesde§! and §YLéon Blum§!, the French section of the Workers' Internation is a revolutionary socialist party. Often focused on symbolic actions, the supporters of the §RSFIO§! are made up of §RSoreliens§!, §RGuesdiens§! and other "types" of radical left-wing activists.\n\nThe §RSFIO§! is certainly the least stable group in the parliament, the socialism idea they represent being a "mille-feuille" of different ideologies of the workers' struggle, from anarchism to syndicalism.§!"

  party_PCF_text:0 "§RCommunist Party§!"
  party_PCF_text_desc:0 "§LFounded following the §RSFIO§!'s coming to power in the early 1910s, §Rthe French Communist Party§! brings together all currents of §Yrevolutionary syndicalism§!. Mostly §RMarxists§!, hostile to capitalism and private property, they constitute the main trade unionist and communist party in France.§!"

  party_2_text:0 "§OIndependent Socialists§!"
  party_2_text_desc:0 "§LMostly composed of left-wing elected officials refusing to affiliate with the radicalism of the §RSFIO§!, the independent socialists are reformists, following the line of the §OPSF (French Socialist Party)§!.\n\nOpportunistic by nature, independents often change allegiances, navigating between discreet support for radicals and a more moderate Republican alliance.§!"
  party_3_text:0 "§8Democratic Republican Alliance§!"
  party_3_text_desc:0 "§L§YThe Democratic Republican Alliance§! is a young party in 1901 founded by §YLéon Gambetta§! and §YRaymond Poincaré§!. It represents a broad coalition of liberals and moderates opposed to the radical activism of extreme parties.\n\nProgressive and advocating §Y“laissez-faire”§!, it is a liberal reformist party.§!"
  party_4_text:0 "§CRadical-Socialist Party§!"
  party_4_text_desc:0 "§L§CThe Republican, radical and radical socialist liberal labor party§! advocating private property, social justice and secularism. Led in part by §YGeorges Clémenceau§!, the party in power between 1906 and 1909 issued major social reforms such as the creation of the Ministry of Labor and the establishment of Sunday rest.\n\nAs a pivotal party, it can count on important figures from the beginning of the century, such as §YCamille Pelletan§! (former minister of the navy) or §YEmile Combes§! (also former prime minister).§!"
  party_5_text:0 "§1Independent Radicals§!"
  party_5_text_desc:0 "§LConsidered as a §1"left-wing republicans"§!, independent radicals are prominent anti-clericals, defenders of republican values and the strict application of the principles of the republic. Less focused on socialism than the §8Democratic Republican Alliance§! or the §CRadical Socialist Party§!, they form a “center” party which does not say its name.\n\nAs a non-formalized entity, the allegiance of the members of this group is very volatile, making them great opportunists....§!"
  party_6_text:0 "§BRepublican Federation§!"
  party_6_text_desc:0 "§LFounded in 1903, it is the main liberal right party supporting a conservative program. Bringing together moderates and progressives opposed to left-wing groups, also called the §O"left cartel"§!, they fight alongside popular politicians like §YAlexandre Ribot§! or §YJules Méline§!.\n\nFavorite of the bourgeoisie and business leaders, the party is opposed to social reforms and supports decentralization of state industries.§!"
  party_7_text:0 "§WConservatives§!"
  party_7_text_desc:0 "§LBringing together fierce conservative political figures, this movement supports the state religion and discreet support for §gmonarchists§! and brings together many right-wing radical opportunists.\n\nFar from being an official party, it is little more than the remains of the republican right of the §Bthird French empire§.§!"
  party_8_text:0 "§WIndependent republicans§!"
  party_8_text_desc:0 "§LMore of a §Y“state of affairs”§! than a party, the republican independents concentrate elected officials who did not wish to join the monarchists or the republican federation.\n\nThis bleak force has no real political future as an entity and is only a form of passage for politicians transitioning from one ideology to another.§!"
  party_9_text:0 "§gPopular Liberal Action§!"
  party_9_text_desc:0 "§LThe liberal monarchist party, in constant war with its political rival §g"Action Française"§!. The group was founded in 1901 by §YJacques Piou§! and §YAlbert de Mun§! under the leadership of §YPope Leo XIII§!. \n\nUnfortunately, the party lost the support of the Pope since 1908 to French action, causing a slow decline in its popularity.§!"
  party_10_text:0 "§LNationalists§!"
  party_10_text_desc:0 "§LA merge of the §gLeague of the French Homeland§! and the §gLeague of Patriots§!, this informal coalition is profoundly §ganti-Dreyfusard§! and anti-left cartel. Sovereignists and populists, the party supports monarchists and revanchism against Germany.\n\nLed by §YGodefroy de Cavaignac§!, the party definitively anchored itself as a complement to the nationalist policies of the §gProudhon circle§!.§!"
  party_11_text:0 "§WVacant§!"
