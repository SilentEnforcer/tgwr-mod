 party_1_text_desc:0 "§LFounded in 1905 by popular figures like §YJean Jaurès§!, §YJules Guesde§! and §YLéon Blum§!, the French section of the Workers' Internation is a revolutionary socialist party. Often focused on symbolic actions, the supporters of the §RSFIO§! are made up of §RSoreliens§!, §RGuesdiens§! and other "types" of radical left-wing activists.\n\nThe §RSFIO§! is certainly the least stable group in the parliament, the socialism idea they represent being a "mille-feuille" of different ideologies of the workers' struggle, from anarchism to syndicalism.§!"
 party_2_text:0 "§OIndependent Socialists§!"
 party_2_text_desc:0 "§LMostly composed of left-wing elected officials refusing to affiliate with the radicalism of the §RSFIO§!, the independent socialists are reformists, following the line of the §OPSF (French Socialist Party)§!.\n\nOpportunistic by nature, independents often change allegiances, navigating between discreet support for radicals and a more moderate Republican alliance.§!"
 party_3_text:0 "§8Democratic Republican Alliance§!"
 party_3_text_desc:0 "§L§YThe Democratic Republican Alliance§! is a young party in 1901 founded by §YLéon Gambetta§! and §YRaymond Poincaré§!.

Led in part by §YGeorges Clémenceau§!, the party in power between 1906 and 1909 issued major social reforms such as the creation of the Ministry of Labor and the establishment of Sunday rest.\n\nAs a pivotal party, it can count on important figures from the beginning of the century, such as §YCamille Pelletan§!

Less focused on socialism than the §8Democratic Republican Alliance§! or the §CRadical Socialist Party§!, they form a “center” party which does not say its name.\n\nAs a non-formalized entity, the allegiance of the members of this group is very volatile, making them great opportunists....§!"

 party_8_text:0 "§WIndependent republicans§!"
