According to it, Germany is a federation of 25 states, each with their own limited rights and self-governance, but all under the permanent presidency of Prussia. The title of king of Prussia is synonymous with the title of Kaiser but even he does not govern absolutely. The Bundesrat, Germany's 'upper house' is made up of representatives of the various states, and the Reichstag, Germany's 'lower house', is led by the chancellor who is second only to the Kaiser.\n\nWhile seemingly a strong foundation of democracy, the German constitution in reality still allows for unprecedented levels of power for any constitutional monarch. With the Kaiser being able to appoint the Chancellor, allowing him to dictate what laws are proposed and vetoed in the Reichstag."

#Agadir aftermath
ww1_germanrework.1.t:0 "Germany's Disgrace"
 ww1_germanrework.1.d:0 "Despite the grandiose posturing and saber-rattling, the end result of the Agadir crisis has been a diplomatic embarrassment. The crisis not only revealed Germany's weak position in the global arena but also severely damaged its prestige. The failure to secure any significant gains from the showdown with France has led to widespread criticism from both within the government and the general public. The Treaty of Fez, which concluded the crisis, saw Germany receive meager concessions in the Congo while France consolidated its hold over Morocco, a clear indicator of German diplomatic failure.\n\nThe public and political backlash has been particularly harsh on Chancellor Theobald von Bethmann Hollweg, whose handling of the situation is seen as weak and indecisive. Many view his leadership as responsible for the national humiliation, arguing that a stronger stance or better negotiation tactics could have yielded more favorable outcomes. The Chancellor's popularity has plummeted, and there is a growing call for his dismissal as a means to restore confidence in the government's ability to uphold German interests and prestige on the world stage. The question now facing the Kaiser is whether to replace Hollweg in hopes of revitalizing the leadership or to endure the current political turmoil with the same leadership."
 ww1_germanrework.1.a:0 "Hollweg should stay"
 ww1_germanrework.1.b:0 "The Kaiser pressures Hollweg to resign"
ww1_germanrework.2.t:0 "The Kaiser Appoints von Heydbrand"
 ww1_germanrework.2.d:0 "In a bold and decisive move, Kaiser Wilhelm II has appointed Ernst von Heydbrand und der Lasa as the new Chancellor of the German Empire. A figure renowned for his staunch conservatism and unwavering dedication to the Prussian ideals, von Heydbrand's ascent marks a significant shift in the political landscape of the empire.\n\nBorn into an aristocratic family, Ernst von Heydbrand has long been a prominent voice in the German Conservative Party. His career has been characterized by a fervent advocacy for the preservation of traditional German values and institutions. A fierce opponent of liberalism and socialism, von Heydbrand has consistently championed policies that strengthen the monarchy, the military, and the agrarian interests that form the backbone of his support.\n\nVon Heydbrand's tenure is expected to usher in an era of intensified conservative governance. With a reputation for his iron will and unyielding principles, he is anticipated to reinforce the Kaiser's vision of a strong, unified Germany, poised to assert its influence on the European stage. However, his appointment is not without controversy, as it risks deepening the divides within the Reichstag and among the populace, who are increasingly restless with the status quo."
 ww1_germanrework.2.a:0 "Good luck to the new chancellor"
ww1_germanrework.19.t:0 "Factions in the Right"
 ww1_germanrework.19.d:0 "The new chancellor is no staunch negotiator like von Hollweg was and will now have to manage the right-wing in his favor if he wishes to stay in power. The traditionalist conservatives and the pan-German nationalists see this as an opportunity to assert their influence over the right-wing factions that the new Chancellor relies on to stay in power. These nationalistic groups, driven by a desire to restore German prestige after the crisis and assert a more aggressive national policy, are vying for control and seeking to push their agendas within the Reichstag.\n\nAmidst this internal power struggle, the Chancellor faces another critical challenge':' the looming threat of the Social Democratic Party in the upcoming 1912 election. The SPD's growing popularity poses a significant risk to the current administration's stability and conservative values. To maintain power and prevent a potential shift in political dominance, the Chancellor must navigate the complex dynamics of right-wing politics, appeasing influential factions while also formulating strategies to curtail the SPD's appeal to the masses. The next few months will be pivotal in determining the future direction of Germany, as the new Chancellor strives to consolidate power and guide the nation through these turbulent times."

#1910 Strikes
ww1_germanrework.3.t:0 "Strikes in Hamburg"
 ww1_germanrework.3.d:0 "Earlier this morning a strike was called in the shipbuilding yards at Hamburg, our principal commercial seaport, current reports estimate that around ten thousand employees have ceased their work. The strike was supported by (and catalysed) by the Deutscher Transportarbeiter-Verband who have been a consistent thorn in the Kaiser's side since their formation earlier this year; highlighting to many within and outside the empire that the rise of socialism in Germany is a real threat to the Kaiser's power.\n\nThe ringleaders of the strike have threatened to continue the strike until their demands of higher wages and shorter hours have been met. Although the demands have been to little avail as the employers are persistent in denying the strikers out of fear of enabling further industrial action. Only time will tell whether the strikers' demands will be met but either way, Germany is sure to suffer more strikes as a consequence soon."
 ww1_germanrework.3.a:0 "We must negotiate with the stikers"
ww1_germanrework.4.t:0 "Clashes with Strikers in Berlin"
 ww1_germanrework.4.d:0 "In the heart of Berlin's industry, the district of Moabit has erupted into chaos. Due to the coal industry's lethal competitiveness, the workers at Kupfer and Co. (recently brought by the most ruthless capitalist in the country - Hugo Stinnes) who have received the short end of this competitiveness through diminishing wages and poor working conditions, have begun a major strike with tens of thousands of workers absent from the coal pits. Initially peaceful, the demonstration mustered support from the general public and quickly turned violent to the point where police escorts had to be given to coal convoys in the city, leading to fierce clashes between protesters and law enforcement.\n\nThe once tranquil streets of Moabit have been transformed into a battleground. Barricades made of debris block major intersections, storefronts are shattered, and the sounds of shouts echo through the district. The scale of the unrest is unprecedented, with the thousands of protesters participating in the upheaval, even criticising the Kaiser and his administration itself.\n\nLaw enforcement have managed to gain control over the situation but these events will certainly raise significant support for socialism in Berlin - one can at least hope the violence will come to an end."

#1910 Debate in Prussian Parliment on the "royal civil list"
ww1_germanrework.5.t:0 "Stormy Debate on the 'Royal Civil List'"
 ww1_germanrework.5.d:0 "A debate broke out in the Prussian House of Representatives today after the issue of the 'royal civil list' arose, where payments from the state budget to the royal family were to be increased at the request of the Kaiser. The Social Democrat, Adolf Hofmann told the representatives that the Kaiser already received a daily income of 43,065 marks without the proposed increase. This criticism of the rise infuriated the centrists and right-wing of the house, with the President of the House calling Hofmann a 'traitor'. While the increase is still sure to pass the SPD's revisionist wing has been put under scrutiny from the right after their seemingly 'traitorous' stance on the matter."

 ww1_germanrework.6.d:0 "In a notable session of the Reichstag, the Zentrum has voiced its concerns over the increasing antisemitic rhetoric within the German Empire's political discourse. The party's leaders highlighted the importance of upholding the principles of equality and respect for all citizens, regardless of their religious background.\n\nThis criticism marks a significant moment as the Zentrum, traditionally focused on moderate and pragmatic policies, calls for a more inclusive and tolerant approach. The party's representatives argued that fostering unity and mutual respect is essential for the stability and progress of the nation.\n\nThe reaction to this stance has been mixed. Some political figures and segments of the populace have welcomed the Zentrum's call for moderation, viewing it as a necessary step towards a more harmonious society. Others, however, have dismissed it as overly idealistic and out of touch with the prevailing sentiments."

The law introduces plural voting rights and the direct election of representatives. Accordingly, only male taxpayers over the age of 24 are entitled to vote, but those aged 50 and over receive an additional vote.

As of the moment, the owners of the mines have yet to even attempt to negotiate with the strikes, clearly planning to wait out the strike. The strike has only been encouraged by the falling standards of living and safety in the mines.\n\nThe SPD has come to the support of the strikes, using them as a stepping stool to gain support among the local workers, the centrists have already shifted to the right in response, proposing financial aid to the owners of the mines to make up for their losses."

Current deaths are totaled at 115 miners. This follows the strikes in the mines earlier this year and the accident has given the far-left of the Rhur reason to once again begin calling for strikes. Whilst the Kaiser and his people mourn for the dead, a government response to the accident is to be printed in the press soon."

These documents have highlighted how large portions of the empire lack vital infrastructure compared to our competitors in Europe, mass urbanization has led to housing shortages and public health growth is minimal - even reverting in some cities. These findings have concerned the Chancellor greatly who is keen to introduce legislature, commit new government investments, and bring in foreign experts to help the construction of a new sewer system to battle the poor public health in our key cities.\n\nThe findings of the national census have not been what many expected and will no doubt play a big part in the left's push for an increase in the Empire's social spending."

It's expected that the topics of discussion will follow the tense military and diplomatic situation in Europe. Specific topics will naturally focus on Russia's 'Great Military Plan', Austria-Hungary's concerns about Serbian military action, and the relationship of the Empire with the British.\n\nKnown attendees include Tirpitz, Muller, Molkte, and Heeringen, with an equally strong presence from the Army and the Navy.\n\nAs preparations and talks about Germany's place in a war in Europe, each day brings war closer to the Reich and do doubt, soon legislature will be passed to expand the German armed forces to meet a new era of war."

#Wilhelmine Germany
ww1_germanrework.21.t:0 "Wilhelmine Germany"
 ww1_germanrework.21.d:0 "The dawn of Wilhelmine Germany marked a new era of industrial prowess and ambitious imperialism under the leadership of Kaiser Wilhelm II - ascending to the throne in 1888. Wilhelm II sought to propel Germany into the ranks of global superpowers, adopting a policy of Weltpolitik to expand German influence and secure a 'place in the sun.'\n\nThe economy flourished with rapid industrialization throughout the second industrial revolution, making Germany a leader in steel production, chemicals, and electrical engineering. This industrial boom fostered a burgeoning middle class and significant urbanization, transforming the societal landscape. This allowed Wilhelm to sanction the expansion of the German navy under admiral Alfred von Tirpitz, reflecting his aspirations for a formidable maritime presence to rival that of Great Britain.\n\nInternally, during the Wilhelmine period Germany witnessed the rise of the Social Democratic Party, representing the growing working class and advocating for more radical social reforms. This rise of the left poses challenges to the conservative establishment, necessitating a delicate balance between modernization and maintaining traditional power structures.\n\nOn the international stage, Germany's assertive foreign policy aimed at colonial expansion and securing alliances created tensions with other European powers - something that has led Germany to become diplomatically isolated and even 'encircled' by the triple entente. However, the formation of the Triple Alliance with Austria-Hungary and Italy still stands and in those two powers, Germany still has some friends left within the content.\n\nFor now, Wilhelmine Germany stands as a testament to the industrial strength of Germany, and her resolve through the many crises she has, and will, face."

#Socialism in Germany
ww1_germanrework.22.t:0 "Socialism in the German Empire"
 ww1_germanrework.22.d:0 "Since the unification of Germany; 1877, the SPD has grown in popularity exponentially. Unlike the right wing of the Reichstag, the left is mostly unified under the SPD with both moderate social democrats and revisionist republicans holding seats for the party's faction. However, the FVp's faction in the Reichstag also holds significant sway in the leftist wing.\n\nOutside of the Reichstag the workers of Germany are significantly unionized under moderate worker's unions - as of late the unions have become more and more restless, and working conditions in the industries have slowly declined with Germany's rise in demand. If not dealt with properly the unions have the power to cripple the economy, the government's saving grace is that the unions are decentralized without a common purpose, allowing the chancellor to make slower reforms that won't upset either the balance of power or the right-wing of the Reichstag."
 ww1_germanrework.22.a:0 "Being progressive won't win wars!"

#The Fleeting Right-Wing
ww1_germanrework.23.t:0 "The Fleeting Right-Wing"
 ww1_germanrework.23.d:0 "Germany's right wing has always been favored by both the aristocracy and farmers, composed of conservative, agricultural, and nationalist parties. However, the decline of right-wing has become more and more clear as the second industrial revolution catalyzed the formation of leftist unions and bolstered support for the Social Democrats. Due to this many of the conservative parties have begun to adapt their policies to ensure they can keep their key voter's support; the conservatives continue to advocate for a self-sufficient economy less reliant on trade, especially with nations like Britain who pose a threat to German ambitions and the agriculturists call for tax exemptions for farmers to give them the support they need to feed the newly urbanized populations. If the right-wing is to revive itself it must set a clear goal that the rightist parties can follow, or else the right will be crushed under the tide of social democracy."

On the outbreak of war, the Constitution of the German Empire ensures that the German Emperor would be made commander-in-chief of the combined armies.\n\nWith the outbreak of war, the Oberste Heeresleitung is now the highest echelon of command of the Heer of the German Empire, led by general Moltke. The OHL is split into sections that will take control over different parts of the country, whilst also monitoring politics and taking over the economy to ensure production remains most efficient for the army.\n\nIn addition to the General Staff of the Field Army, the Supreme Army Command consists of the Emperor's Military Cabinet, the Intendant General (responsible for supply), senior advisers in various specialist fields (Artillery, Engineers, Medicine, Telegraphy, Munitions and Railways) and representatives from the four German War Ministries and representatives of the other Central Powers.

The centrists are led by the trusted Zentrum party who formed in 1870, went on to successfully battle against the Kulturkampf waged by Chancellor Otto von Bismarck against the Catholic Church. It soon won a quarter of the seats in the Reichstag, and its middle position on most issues allowed it to play a decisive role in the formation of majorities. However, there are plenty of centrist parties in Germany who seek to make moderate social reform whilst ensuring that German traditional values are kept.\n\nIf Germany is going to continue to be stable throughout the next decade, the centrists must keep their power in Germany so that a moderate amount of rightist and leftist laws are passed into the Bundestrat. Luckily, many of the key political figures in Germany, like Theobald von Bethmann Hollweg, support the centrists and have aided them in keeping their majority in the Reichstag. "

 ww1_germanrework.42.d:0 "Pan-Germanism was highly influential in German politics in the 19th century during the unification of Germany when the German Empire was proclaimed as a nation-state in 1871 but without Habsburg Austria, Luxembourg, and Liechtenstein their goals were never truly achieved. After the unification, from the late 19th century, many Pan-Germanist thinkers, who since 1891 were organized in the Pan-German League, had adopted openly ethnocentric and racist ideologies, even calling for the annexation of Austria. The organization has greatly supported the educated middle and upper class; promoting German nationalist consciousness, especially among ethnic Germans outside Germany. In his three-volume work, "Deutsche Politik" (1905-07), Hasse called for German imperialist expansion in Europe which many of the League have taken to heart.\n\nHowever, since the dawn of this new millennium, the Pan-Germans have taken a moderate stance to Austria, instead focusing on annexations in Russia and France. It seems for now the Pan-Germans have abandoned the annexationist policy around Austria."

#Starting Political Tree
GER_wilhelmine_germany:0 "Wilhelmine Germany"
GER_wilhelmine_germany_desc:0 "Kaiser Wilhelm II took power in 1888, since his ascension a new age has dawned on Germany marking new stances on matters, both political and cultural in Germany. Politically the Kaiser has undone much of Bismark's diplomacy, encircling Germany by aggravating the Russians and the British, but at heart Wilhelm is still a man of the people, stopping the trade union oppression that took place under Bismark and instead seeking the best for his people's lives. Above all Wilhelm's ambitions lay in expanding the empire and giving Germany 'a place in the sun'."
GER_freie_volksbuhne:0 "Die Freie Volksbuhne"
GER_freie_volksbuhne_desc:0 "'Die Freie Volksbuhne' or 'The People's Free Stage' was founded in 1890 as a worker's theatre by Bruno Wille, designed as a 'social democrat' form of art that would cater to the working class themselves. It's a political organization that was founded even with the anti-socialist laws in place, highlighting our fight for social democracy. Whilst the Kaiser and his men might think themselves content and safe, it's up to us, the social democrats to prove to them that change is needed, and that change is coming to Germany."
GER_appoint_solf_as_colonial_secretary:0 "Appoint Solf as Colonial Secretary"
GER_appoint_solf_as_colonial_secretary_desc:0 "Wilhelm Solf, a wealthy and liberal administrator is the perfect candidate to replace the current Colonial Secretary who's barbaric policy has only inflamed resistance overseas. Solf believes that by increasing the standards of living in the colonies and assimulating them into German culture, we can truly pacify the colonies. Both the left and the right are appeased by this choice due to Solf's pragmatic polices."
GER_productional_efficiency:0 "Productional Efficiency"
GER_productional_efficiency_desc:0 "The best way to ensure we are ensuring that the colonies benefit the empire the most is to introduce firm but fair measures that would ensure increased quotas are met by increasing work hours but allowing workers a shorter work week. Solf assures the chancellor that the measures will be met with minimal resistance and optimal production."
GER_nationalising_colonial_diamond_deposists:0 "Nationalise Colonial Diamond Deposits"
GER_nationalising_colonial_diamond_deposists_desc:0 "There are plenty of Diamonds in our colonial empire but the companies we let run them don't operate to the maximum efficiency they could do, therefore under the recommendation of Solf to work towards productional efficiency we shall nationalize the diamond deposits and create a state-ran organization to exploit the deposits."
GER_deal_with_the_sokehs_rebellion:0 "Deal with the Sokehs Rebellion"
GER_deal_with_the_sokehs_rebellion_desc:0 "This little rebellion has gone on long enough, we'll send a ship and some men to arrest, or kill, the rebels. If needed we'll just raze the damn island to kingdom come."
GER_organise_german_settlement:0 "Organise German Settlement"
GER_organise_german_settlement_desc:0 "To truly pacify the colonies, we must assimilate them into our culture, the best way to do this is to organize German settlers from the Fatherland to come and live in areas where they can work whilst bringing German culture along with them. As they integrate into the community the colonials will soon take the superior cultural aspects from as and adapt to them."
GER_colonial_cooperation_with_belgian_companies:0 "Colonial Cooperation with Belgian Companies"
GER_colonial_cooperation_with_belgian_companies_desc:0 "The Belgian Congo is rich with wealth, we should approach the companies working there to work mutually on exploiting our bordering colonies. This will return some wealth to us that we can invest where we see fit."
GER_finance_the_east_african_railway_project:0 "Finance the East African Railway Project"
GER_finance_the_east_african_railway_project_desc:0 "Solf has delivered a plan to construct a railway in east Africa that will vitalize the region, whilst also helping to supply our troops there who until now have a difficult job ensuring they are supplied."
GER_pass_the_job_placement_act:0 "Job Placement Act"
GER_pass_the_job_placement_act_desc:0 "We need to introduce legislature that will ensure that the unemployed and the work-shy are put to work, especially in the industrial sector. This act will help to reduce the effects of the rampart urbanisation that the country has gone through leaving our people and administration behind."
GER_conduct_a_national_census:0 "Conduct a National Census"
GER_conduct_a_national_census_desc:0 "It's time to conduct another national census, the results may be slightly disheartening in Urban areas but otherwise, the government is sure that living standards and the like are still acceptable. As with all national census', it will incur a cost to conduct said census."
GER_hollwegs_push_for_a_national_pension:0 "Hollweg's push for a National Pension"
GER_hollwegs_push_for_a_national_pension_desc:0 "Hollweg has created a proposal for adements to the current national pension schemes to increase the profitability for them for individuals but also expand the pension to the ethnic minorities inside the empire. Whilst the conservatives claim this is a disgrace to give non-Germans, 'German' money, it will create more economic incentives for consumer spending."
GER_hand_out_agricultural_incentives:0 "Hand out Agricultural Incentives"
GER_hand_out_agricultural_incentives_desc:0 "With the demographic shift in Germany, the agricultural side of Germany has suffered setbacks due to a lack of manpower. Therefore the government must give grants to those who seek jobs at farms, as well as give grants to farmers so that they may buy more efficent equipment to make up for the lack of people."
GER_the_reich_to_bavaria_railway:0 "The Reich-Bavaria Railway"
GER_the_reich_to_bavaria_railway_desc:0 "It's been proposed by the Prussian administration that a new railway be constructed between Berlin and Munich to not only incentivize economic growth in the two areas but also increase Bavaria's commitment to the empire, as one of the largest states in the empire."
GER_a_constitution_for_alsace:0 "A Constitution for Alsace"
GER_a_constitution_for_alsace_desc:0 "The state of Alsace-Lorraine was annexed into Germany alongside our victory over the French in the Franco-Prussian war, it's time to integrate it as a real state in our empire rather than simple crown land. Alsace will be given a place in the Bundestrat and the state will have the same rights as all others."
GER_german_peoples_get_german_pensions:0 "German Peoples get German Pensions"
GER_german_peoples_get_german_pensions_desc:0 "Hollweg's idea to hand out German state benefits to ethnic minorities is damn right disrespectful to everything our empire stands for. We will be increasing the pension, but only for the benefit of German workers."
GER_memories_of_1871:0 "Memories of 1871"
GER_memories_of_1871_desc:0 "The year 1871 marks the founding of our empire and our victory over the French in the Franco-Prussian War. It was Bismark who truly led the unification efforts to victory, and it's he who endorsed the right wing of Germany, giving them the endorsement of German politics. Whilst their parties don't control the Reichstag, it's the right wing who controls Germany. The Aristocracy, the army, and the capitialists, all submit to right-wing rhetoric."
GER_treading_the_centre_line:0 "Treading the Centre Line"
GER_treading_the_centre_line_desc:0 "In times like this Germany must maintain a steady course that allows the nation to survive and unite under a common cause, to battle the many threats to the German nation that approach us at rapid speed."

GER_the_growing_pan_german_influence_desc:0 "The Pan-Germans are a group of individuals who believe that Germans across Europe must be united into one sovereign empire, whilst hosting a small amount of members, they are still one of the most influential groups of people in the Empire."
GER_prussian_militarism_at_its_finest:0 "Prussian Militarism at its Finest"
GER_prussian_militarism_at_its_finest_desc:0 "'An Army with a State' is how Prussia was described, it's that rampant militarism that brought us to unification. That same spirit must be encouraged today, for we stand in Europe alone against the Entente and war is brewing on the horizon."
GER_campaining_for_the_german_identity:0 "Persecute Polish Landowners"
GER_campaining_for_the_german_identity_desc:0 "In the empire, there are significant portions that are occupied mainly by Polish landowners, who don't conform to our ideals and live in a silent cultural resistance. We must Germanize these people and properly incorporate them into our empire."
GER_adressing_the_matter_of_german_identity:0 "Adress the Matter of German Identity"
GER_adressing_the_matter_of_german_identity_desc:0 "The matter of German identity and German claims has been debated ever since the Frankfurt parliament was established during the German revolutions. It's clear to all that German lands are occupied by other ethnic nationalities, but whilst the conservatives call for their expulsion and replacement with true Germans, the center and left of Germany call for the non-Germans in the empire to be integrated instead, we must decide our course of action."
GER_an_empire_of_many_peoples:0 "An Empire of Many Peoples..."
GER_an_empire_of_many_peoples_desc:0 "We're an empire that includes many different people, and all should come to willingly integrate into our culture. By passing a new act on nationality that includes the minorities in the empire we are advocating for their willing integration."
GER_but_a_german_empire_first:0 "... But a German One First!"
GER_but_a_german_empire_first_desc:0 "Whether they inhabit German lands now is irrelevant, all minorities in rightful German lands are in the wrong, through measures like the Prussian Settlement Commission and this new legislation we can dismantle the rights of non-Germans to force them out of our empire."

GER_the_matter_of_the_navy_desc:0 "Since 1898, we've passed a series of four naval laws focusing on expanding the capabilities of our fleet - all under the guidance of Admiral von Tirpitz. Our current navy stands tall as one of the best in the world, really only trailing behind the Royal Navy in Britain.

GER_propose_immediate_rustungswende_desc:0 "To ensure our military-industrial complex can keep up with the planned expansion of the ground forces, we must take resources from our navy, which to this point has been favored, and give them to the army. It may upset the admirality but in the end, it will be more beneficial to Germany if we can grow our army to match the Entente powers."

GER_demand_angola_desc:0 "Part of the UK's agreement after the Haldane mission was that they wouldn't oppose our ambitions in the colonies, however, perhaps we can persuade them to aid us in making demands for the annexation of Angola in payment for Portugal's financial debts - the British may even be able to claim something themselves."
