 FE_IRONMAN:0 "Ironman Mode (NOT RECOMMENDED)"
 FE_IRONMAN_TOOLTIP:0 "In Ironman mode, console cheats are disabled and the game is automatically saved regularly to a single file. In games played with this setting, there is no turning back.\nSince it is an overhaul mod making the game achievements unavailable, this means, this is useless, it is better to turn off this feature to get supported for the mod gameplay (bugs etc.)"
