Just like when the Han Dynasty put down the Yellow Turban Rebellion, we had to call upon and offer great amounts of autonomy to leaders of local New Armies to defeat the revolution, and our empire has completely fractured. While we remain in power in Beijing, with some influence over these regional lords, we have little control anymore of what happens in the south of our country."

Thought to be exiled in America, Chiang has adopted the name "Zhong Liao", and disguised himself as an ordinary restaurant owner in his hometown. Perhaps he hid this attraction poorly; the restaurant was abbreviated as "KMT".\n\nWhen authorities confronted the location, they were attracted by the delicious smell of fried rice. Instead of detaining Chiang, they instead indulged in a great meal.

He began his career as an army secretary at Li Hongzhang's camp in Anqing, Anhui province during the Taiping Rebellion, who served Li the longest, from 1860 to Li's death in 1901.\n\nThe other candidate is Zhang Zhenfang, a cousin of Yuan Shikai. He was personally recommended by Yuan Shikai to become the governor, but he is not loyal to the dynasty, he is loyal to his corrupt cousin. He is a choice, though.\n\nThe third, and last candidate is Natong. In the first year of Xuantong, he was appointed Minister of Military Aircraft. In 1911, he became an associate minister of the "Royal Cabinet". Choosing him would appease both sides, since he is not pro-Yuan, nor Pro-western.\n\nNow, the fate of Zhili Province will be decided by the Son of Heaven."

Constantly being spoiled and revered, the emperor soon realized the absolute power he wielded and frequently has his eunuchs beat for the smallest transgressions. With his every whim catered to while no one ever said no to him, the Emperor has become a sadistic boy who loves to have his eunuchs flogged.\n\nIn one instance, the emperor wanted to reward a eunuch who gave him a puppet show with a cake filled with iron fillings, and was only talked out of it with great difficulty."

 ww1_qing.289.d:0 "In March 1910, Wang Jingwei, a member of the Tongmenghui, was keen on raising popularity among the populace against the Qing. With their morale at an all time low after multiple failed revolutions since 1905, the assassination of Prince Chun, or Zaifeng, father of the emperor Puyi and current regent was being planned, with Wang Jingwei offering to sacrifice his life detonating the bomb.\n\nWhile Puyi resides safely within the walls of the Forbidden City, his father, the regent Zaifeng, travels often between his mansion and the palace. Wang intented to detonate a bomb on a bridge in between to kill Zaifeng and decapitate the imperial court. \n\nHis plan was foiled after the bomb was discovered. At first, it was suspected that the incident was the result of court intrigue, perhaps orchestrated by Yikuang, unhappy with Zaifeng's role as regent. However, investigators soon closed in on Wang and captured him. The only question now is, what is his fate?\n\nSummary: Tongmenghui Revolutionary Wang Jingwei attempts to assasinate the prince regent Zaifeng, fails and is captured. What is his punishment?"

 ww1_qing.253.d:0 "In 1900, the United States were given a share of the Boxer Indemnities. Believing it to be too much, they offered to re-invest this into our country. Many plans were proposed, such as Yuan Shikai's infrastructure plan, but in the end, it was agreed that the indemnity would be reduced by $10.8 million on the condition it was used to setup a western style university. This university would be located on the site of the former imperial Tsinghua Gardens to form the new Tsinghua College, staffed by several prominent US and Chinese scholars such as Liang Qichao. \n\nThe agreement was approved in 1909 by Theodore Roosevelt and the US Congress and is now ready to be implemented."

They alleged that Yang had bypassed the provincial assembly and gained imperial permission to issue the debt directly. After much debate, the PCA decided that Yang did in fact overreach his powers and broke the law, and appealed to the Court for guidence in deciding the punishment. \n\nInstead, our Grand Council shocked the PCA by drafting an edict in the name of the Emperor outright refusing to punish Yang, only criticising him for being careless. The PCA is completely outraged, but powerless in the face of the Emperor's edict. What should we do?"
