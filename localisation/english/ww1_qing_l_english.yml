  ww1_qing.432.t:0 "New Viceroy of Zhili"
  ww1_qing.432.d:0 "After Chen's resignation, Zhili is left without a viceroy. However, there are a few choices of who we can appoint as the new viceroy.\n\nFirst, is Zhou Fu. He previously served as Viceroy of Liangjiang in 1904–1906 and Viceroy of Liangguang in 1906–1907. He is a pro-foreign official, and is very skilled at governing. He began his career as an army secretary at Li Hongzhang's camp in Anqing, Anhui province during the Taiping Rebellion, who served Li the longest, from 1860 to Li's death in 1901.\n\nThe other candidate is Zhang Zhenfang, a cousin of Yuan Shikai. He was personally recommended by Yuan Shikai to become the governor, but he is not loyal to the dynasty, he is loyal to his corrupt cousin. He is a choice, though.\n\nThe third, and last candidate is Natong. In the first year of Xuantong, he was appointed Minister of Military Aircraft. In 1911, he became an associate minister of the "Royal Cabinet". Choosing him would appease both sides, since he is not pro-Yuan, nor Pro-western.\n\nNow, the fate of Zhili Province will be decided by the Son of Heaven."
  ww1_qing.432.a:0 "Zhou Fu, the pro-western official!"
  ww1_qing.432.b:0 "Zhang Zhenfang, Yuan Shikai's cousin!"

However, after the rebellion in the south started, Zhao Erfeng has proven himself incapable of suppressing the republican rebels.\n\nHowever, since Zhao Erfeng, one of our most skilled generals, was recently captured by the rebels and beheaded by republican generals. Our court wants to punish the rebels, however we first need to destroy them.\n\nSending Duanfang into the south, along with the Hubei New Army, would greatly help the Sichuan Garrison in destroying the rebels, but would come at a cost of leaving Hubei open to revolutionary activity. Now the decisions is up to the court, and Duanfang is ready to quell the uprising."

  ww1_qing.430.d:0 "News has reached the court the Yuan Shikai has held a secret meeting with the revolutionaries where they discussed the status of China, and the potential for Shikai to defect. Shikai has denied doing this, but, while Shikai still works for us right now, it is clear his loyalty is nonexistant, and that he will soon betray us\n\nThis event occured because our Proto-Fascist support lingered above 75% for too long."
  ww1_qing.430.a:0 "We still need him"

  ww1_qing.429.d:0 "Zaize, Puwei, and several Manchu princes have come to the court begging us to remove Shikai. They cite the danger of Yuan Shikai and that Shikai seems to be increasingly friendly with the revolutionaries.\n\nThis event occured because our Proto-Fascist support lingered above 75% for too long."
  ww1_qing.429.a:0 "Huh? Yuan Shikai is a good man!"
  ww1_qing.429.b:0 "Exactly, we need to atleast reduce Shikai's influence a little"

  ww1_qing.427.t:0 "Shandong Surrenders"
  ww1_qing.427.d:0 "Sun Baoqi, governor of Shandong, has long shown disloyalty to our government, and joined the revolutionaries in declaring independence. However, it has become clear to him after our army descended on Shandong that he was mistaken and has cancelled the declaration, also resigning from office. Much of the Shandong New Army followed suit, although some areas of Shandong still refuse to surrender. What should we do to him?"
  ww1_qing.427.a:0 "Don't punish him, maybe it will get more governors to defect"

Yuan Dahua has resigned in the face of unprecedented revolutionary activity, and local leaders are plotting an uprising to go in pair with the current [GetXinhaiUprisingName] Revolution. \n\nWe could divert troops and attention to the region to delay them until atleast the end of the Tongmenghui revolution, or we can simply face it."
  ww1_qing.426.a:0 "No matter, we crushed them before we will crush them again!"

  ww1_qing.425.d:0 "The Qing have completely refused to work with Yuan Shikai, and Shikai has realized he has nothing to gain from continued loyalty to the enemy. He has offered to work with us to overthrow them - on one condition. He wants to lead the new republic that follows as president. Should we accept this power hungry man?"

 ww1_qing.423.d:0 "During Cheong Fatt Tze's visit to the USA, he learned much about the nation's rapidly growing industry, visiting the young nation's various urban cities and vast factories, seeking to replicate its success in his own business ventures. Now returning, he has shared some of these US industrialization tips with our government"

 ww1_qing.422.d:0 "Cheong Fatt Tze, also known as Zhang Bishi, has been sent to the USA to study the country's industry, in hopes of us replicating their industrial success. Doing most of his business in the Dutch East Indies and Indochina, Cheong has stopped in Hong Kong, and will continue to the USA soon. He has recieved a Ph.D. in law from the British there, and we are very thankful to Cheong for his previous roles as Minister of Industry. \n\nWe could ask him to invest in the United States, which would give us profit long-term, or we could simply let him continue with his journey. An investment into the USA would be costly, and would take a lot of money, but Cheong suggested paying from his own net worth. Alternatively, we could recall him back to China, since the Middle Kingdom is surely strong enough to industralize on it's own!"
 ww1_qing.422.a:0 "Wish him a good time!"
 ww1_qing.422.b:0 "Give him some extra money to invest with too!"
 ww1_qing.422.c:0 "Actually, we need him in China right now"

 ww1_qing.421.d:0 "After having returned from the mission in the USA, and having send us his report of the United States industry, Cheong has went back to the Dutch East Indies. However, upon his return, he died from pneumonia in Batavia. His body was sent back to China to be buried, and we sent a high-ranking official to his funeral. We have ordered the court to record his life in historical documents so that his contributions will always be remembered. Both the British Raj and the Dutch authorities ordered flags to be flown at half mast to honour the man who was known as 'the Rockefeller of the East'."

 ww1_qing.420.d:0 "Duanfang, a member of the Plain White Banner, has been sent to Hankou, after the Railway Protection Movement erupted over the nationalization of railways. When he arrived there, he took control of the Hubei New Army, and after Zhao was removed from power in Sichuan, became the temporary acting governor. However, after the new army mutinied, an officer by the name of Liu Yifeng killed Duanfang, as part of a general wave of anti Manchu violence during the revolution."

Duanfang, Governor-General of Liangjiang, and Cheng Qitai, Governor of Jiangsu, submitted a suggestion to the court, proposing that China should host an international exposition. It is an official fair backed by the court. \n\nA site of about 41 acres near San Pai Lou has been established for the exhibition. Along a main axis road are several exhibit buildings including the Administration Building, Fine Arts Building, Agriculture Building, Transportation Building, Foreign Exhibits Buildings, and then several buildings for the Chinese Provinces."

Everyone knows that Yuan Shikai's only use was to take down the revolutionaries, and now he serves no use to the court. Prominent court officials are already preparing to depose him, and only time will tell if he will survive the political coup..."

 ww1_qing.415.t:0 "Democratic Disaster"
 ww1_qing.415.d:0 "Due to overwhelming democratic popularity, several prominent governors have been pressured to jointly and openely denounce our government and call for a republic. While these men have been captured and executed, the populace is in extreme agitation, and any moment now the Tongmenghui will seize the oppurtunity and ignite the rebellion!"

 ww1_qing.413.d:0 "Pu Wei, a loyal member of the Qing dynasty, was the son of Empress Dowager Cixi's close friend Prince Gong, and has since inherited the title. When Emperor Guangxu died in 1908, it is suspected Pu Wei was a potential heir. Now, Pu Wei has been given a role as 'Minister of Smoking', a arbitrary role suspected to be because prominent officials such as Zaifeng dont like how close he was to the throne. More conservative court officials such as Yikuang and Natong think the loyal man should be awarded a more prestigious role, while others like Zaifeng are quite satisfied with him being away from real politics. \n\nMaking a choice either way will inevitably offend one side of the court."
 ww1_qing.413.a:0 "Keep this potential rival away from the throne!"
 ww1_qing.413.b:0 "Agreed, a more prestigious rank"
 ww1_qing.413.c:0 "Who the hell cares?"

 ww1_qing.412.d:0 "On his was home, Liangbi was attacked by a suicide bomber. The suicide bomber was Peng Jiazhen, a member of the Beijing Tongmenghui Society, and attacked Liangbi when he stepped out of a hotel. The bomber was hit in the head by shrapnel and died instantly. Liangbi's leg was severely wounded and he later died of his injuries, only calling the attacker a 'strange man'. Perhaps an expansion of the imperial guard could have prevented this?"

Now, he takes the role of presidency from Sun Yat-sen, the interim president of the Republic of China. \nAs the revolutionaries and many people feared, he abandoned his promises and placed the capital of the Republic of China in Beijing, not Nanjing, and already seems to be trying to establish dictatorial power."

After the humiliating loss to the Japanese in the 1895 First Sino-Japanese War, reformers, including Kang Youwei, worked with the Guangxu Emperor to outline, against the wishes of Empress Dowager Cixi, an ambitious reform program. \n\nThus, in 1898, began the 100 days reform, where radical reorganization of the Qing government structure and backwards traditions was planned and signed by the emperor with the help of Kang Youwei.\n\nHowever, it soon became apparent that conservative elements within the country ran too deep to be ready for reform. Cixi quickly organized a coup, and all depended on the decision of Yuan Shikai, who controlled the Beiyang Army. Although once a reformist ally, once again, Yuan Shikai switched sides, supporting Cixi coup the government, capturing most reformers and taking all power away from the emperor. Kang Youwei escaped to Canada.\n\nAfter executing the captured reformers, most intellectuals in the country turned against the government to the revolutionaries, believing our government hopeless. However, since then, we have undertaken reforms so radical they weren’t even considered by the original 100 Days Reform.\n\nSince, we have discussed shifting government policy on the 100 Days Reform and those responsible for crushing it.

 ww1_qing.335.d:0 "In Europe, and others influenced by it such as the United States and Japan, the bureaucracy has developed into the same refined method. A group of ministers, each managing a department, advise the chief executive on state affairs.\n\nThe Qing bureaucratic monarchy differs significantly from the ministerial system, despite initial visual similarities. Responsible for a vast, multi-ethinic empire, the Chinese governments have developed an intricate but outdated bureaucracy centered in Beijing over the last 700 years. \n\nThe central government includes prominent offices such as the Six Boards and the Censorate Grand Council handling administrative tasks, offering counsel to the emperor. However, these Six Boards are not like western institutions, being completely interconnected and with many officials holding multiple roles at the same time across multiple boards and the Grand Council. \n\nIn reality, there is no distinction between central, provincial, and local state functions. As such, to institute any of their ideas, the Boards must receive vast cooperation across all hierarchies of the 9 tier bureaucracy.\n\nIn addition, every official is appointed by the top, from the Grand Council to the most local administrators. The result has been a sort of inflation of officials, with too many qualified candidates to fit and thus many administrative roles being overfilled. The Six Boards often have executive committees of six equally ranked ministers each.\n\nThis system causes extreme problems for the empire. No minister is singly responsible for the actions of a position, or the conduct and corruption involved, and it is impossible to assign blame. The system has allowed corruption to grow rampant, as officials are overstretched covering multiple roles at the same time while there are too many unnecessary ones in obsolete roles.\n\nIn essence, the system is designed to prevent any one official from accumulating too much power, and to maximize the capability of the Emperor to intervene in any affair. In practice, the sheer amount of paperwork diverts all power to the conservative Manchu Grand Council. In addition, the Qing bureaucracy may be very stable but it is not nimble. Even the smallest reforms cannot be passed or implemented without broad consensus among officials, and systemic change requires either complete consensus or the hand of a reforming emperor.\n\n Strategy Recommendation - These two branches are concurrently exclusive (click the icon in tree to read description), meaning you can switch between them.

The first modern factories began to open up, such as the Jiangnan Arsenal. \n\nThe 14 year Taiping Rebellion was crushed by 1864, and the Russians were kicked out of Xinjiang by the new Beiyang army. When the stubborn and incapable Tongzhi emperor died in 1875, and with Ci’an passing away, and Cixi installed the Guangxu emperor with herself wielding absolute power and reforms continued.\n\nThis is a time when a light could be seen in the Qing’s future, small as it was.

In this, they argue that tradition confucian values must be upheld above all else, while also argueing it is okay to reform the legal code in a western manner. \n\nThere is also an argument over 'Legal Morals', in the question of whether or not it is permissible to make laws on moral issues, such as outlawing adultery. \n\nAnyway, the debate over these issues has reached a point where we will need to intervene."

It is meant to simulate the experience of a Qing noble, where you must keep ontop of the options you have and what you can and could do. With this historical difficulty, if you're reactionary like the Qing court and only react when events show up, you will be crushed and collapse. \n\nIt is also important to realize, however, that Hearts of Iron 4 is a video game, one where historical accuracy is not an excuse for a bad experience playing the mod.  Especially for first time players of the Qing Dynasty in this mod, perhaps you would rather have a more casual game, and it would be very hard to understand all the mechanisms you have to keep the Qing surviving. \n\nWith this in mind, I have begun the implementation of a difficulty system. This is highly experimental, so may be removed or expanded in the future, with there only being 3 options as of now. For now, your choice now cannot be changed after making your decision.

Throughout the game, we will get ‘snippets’ of history so that it is not overwhelming. The final one will unlock something…\n\n§OOur court§!, consisting of many Manchu Princes, officials, and conservative advisors, has been extremely reactionary to any reform, although willing to adapt some to save the dynasty. §RThey will stall any reform we attempt to pass, and we will either need to wait to calm them down, or appease/get around them through other methods.§!\n\n§CThe Tongmenghui§!, lead by Sun Yat-sen, is one of among many groups of revolutionary organizations who want the establishment of a republic. Sun Yat-sen, tired of the reactionary Qing court refusing to adopt any new technology and powerlessly watching as foreign powers trample their way around China, has concluded that the only way to save the country is to drive the Manchus out. Alongside him, the entire nation is increasingly anti-monarchist, and it will only take a spark to start a revolution. §R If the revolution timer ever reaches 0, a large scale revolution will breakout, where we can choose to play as the Republic. Even if crushed, the timer will begin again, and more will sprout up shortly if reform is not adopted. There is also a way to transition to a republic through the focus tree.§!\n\nThe Qing reforms have proven successful in the military. §GThe Beiyang New Army§!, lead by Yuan Shikai, is seemingly loyal to the dynasty, and remains the only real military force in China, with most other troops we have being regional armies and a few Manchu swordsmen and archers. In 1898, he crushed the 100 Days Reform, but since the ascension of the Xuantong Emperor, he has been forcefully exiled in Manchuria. §RHis exile was seen as disrespectful and shameful, and in the case of revolution against the empire, Yuan Shikai may not have any reason to remain loyal to the dynasty.§! Still, the Beiyang army acts as the balance to the fight between revolutionaries and the Qing. Both want Shikai on their side  §RBeiyang (Proto-Fascist) Influence can be used for political power, but too much endangers our stability and power. Hiring Yuan Shikai would mean recalling him from exile!§!\n\nThere are many in China ready for change, and many plans to reform China. As the country increasingly becomes more regional, the question of whether the country will even stay together remains uncertain as well.§R The only question is who will lead China through these tumultuous years...?§!"

They have asked you to try to comprehend what it is talking about. \n\nHere it reads: \n-------------------------------------\n'Hello! I am the developer for Qing. The content in this nation started as a submod long ago, and has now finally been integrated!! Anyway, thank you for taking the time out of your day to try it out.\n\nEssential Tips:\n\n- Use the Beiyang Army decisions. There is a reason they are at the top of the decisions!\n\n- The revolution is very hard to completely avoid, and very hard to fight, and fighting multiple revolutions is not uncommon. Instead of thinking about how to completely avoid the revolution, perhaps a better question would be whens the most strategic time to let the revolution happen.'\n-------------------------------------\n\nThere appears to be two more notes in the bottle.

There is also a way to peacefully transition. NOTE: China update is not yet done, so content may be spares.\n\n- Like the Qing nobles, you may choose not to read events, descriptions, and decisions. However, it is recommended to read them, as it will help you have a better understanding of the history and whats going on, as well as being able to grasp the situation at hand, allowing you to better predict future disasters that may be coming. \n\n- Decisions are extremely important. Keep track of them.\n\n- Keep track of weekly stability. \n\n- Almost everything is done through decisions, events, party popularity, and national spirits.\n\n- It is highly recommended that you interact with the Beiyang army decisions. It is essential for political power\n\n- The revolution is designed to be almost impossible to avoid entirely. Don’t be disappointed if you have to fight one or even a few of them.\n\n- More things to either worry about or use to modernize will show up over time\n\n- Events are common, so be prepared for your plans to be dashed if you linger too close to the edge\n\n-The anti-Court opposition decisions quickly refresh, and if you have spare political power or Xinhai days, it is easy to get rid of them"

Because conditions were not suitable for the constitution's implementation yet, we began a process of 'Preparative Constitutionalism'. As such, we plan form an advisory council that will act as a 'Political Consultive Assembly (PCA)'. The elections occured in 1909, and the PCA will begin in October 1910. Still, all actions are subject to veto by the Emperor alone"
