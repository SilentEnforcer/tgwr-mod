 POL_jozef_pilsudski_desc:0 "A social and independence activist, former leader of the Polish Socialist Party, founder of the PPS Fighting Organisation and the Polish Military Organisation, commander of the 1st Brigade of the Polish Legions; Józef Piłsudski, surrounded by a cult among his soldiers and supporters, hated by his political enemies is a charismatic individual seeking to exercise dictatorial power in Poland as Chief of State. His character resembles the 18th century romantic and charismatic megalomaniac, his idol is Napoleon Bonaparte, whom he admires and whose spirit was to fly over the Pilsudski family's house at the birth of Józef. The Commandant, so called by his soldiers, is a supporter of the imperial Poland as a guide of the federation of countries located between the Baltic and the Black Sea, the Intermarium. In fact, an anti-Russian, former Siberian exile, Piłsudski would most like to see Russia within its ethnographic borders. During his imprisonment in Magdeburg by the Germans, his legend in the country grew significantly and he became a person who could count on the support of society and left-wing parties during the growing social and revolutionary moods in Poland. The handing over of power to him by the Regency Council led to the moment for which Józef Piłsudski and his supporters was waiting for, becoming a dictator of Poland. However, Polish society is striving to rebuild the country on democratic principles and to restore the Sejm, the Polish Parliament. At such an important moment for Poland, the Commandant is conscious of the need to cooperate with all parties in the country and to strive for the formation of the Sejm, but this does not mean that he will resign from the function of the Chief of the State and stop strengthening his position and building his cult in society and the army, using the intrigues he has learned during the hard times of conspiracy. One thing is certain, Józef Piłsudski plays his own game about Poland and nobody really knows how it will end, quoting the Commandant: "My head is full of the wildest contradictions!""
 POLITICS_REGENCY_COUNCIL_1918_DESC:0 "The Regency Council was established by the German and Austro-Hungarian occupation authorities on the basis of the patent on state authority in the Kingdom of Poland of 12 September 1917 granted by these authorities. Is composed of Aleksander Kakowski, Zdzisław Lubomirski and Józef Ostrowski. Power of the Regency Council were limited in favour of the occupants - in cases where the administration was not transferred to the Polish state authority. The Regency Council appointed the first Polish government under the leadership of Jan Kucharzewski. This government took over the administration departments, transferred by the occupying authorities. Protesting against the agreement of a peace treaty between the Central Powers and Ukraine on February 13, 1918, the Regency Council announced that it would exercise the right to power based on the will of the Nation, believing that the Nation wishes to have a symbol of its independence and intends to stand around this symbol. On October 7, 1918, the Regency Council proclaimed Poland's independence, citing 14 Wilson's points accepted a few days earlier by the Central Powers, and on October 12, the Regency Council took over from the occupiers power over the army. On 21 October, the German General Governor of Warsaw, Hans von Beseler, submitted the office of the Commander-in-Chief of the Polish Armed Forces. On 25 October, Józef Świeżyński's cabinet was appointed and on 28 October, the RC appointed Gen. Tadeusz Rozwadowski as Head of the General Staff of the Polish Army. The General immediately joined the organisation of the General Staff and the Ministry of Military Affairs. On 3 November, the Świeżyński cabinet tried to carry out a coup d'état against the Council, but the Regency Council removed the cabinet, appointing in its place a provisional governmental chaired by Władysław Wróblewski. On 11 November, the Regency Council handed over the military authority and the command of the Polish army to Józef Piłsudski; the next day, it entrusted him with the mission of forming a government, but in the face of public pressure, it resigned from this intention. The Regents are unpopular among the society and the revolution is highly probable, the fate of Poland depends on their decision."

 POL_not_yet_lost: "Poland Is Not Yet Lost!"
 POL_not_yet_lost_desc: "After the Great War and the defeat in it, of all three partitioners, the dream of many generations of Poles about their desired independence finally came true. Years of captivity of Poland being in the shackles of the partitioners, strengthened by the spirit of romanticism and messianism, expressed in the literature of Mickiewicz and Słowacki, bought with the blood shed in the national uprisings of November 1831 and January 1863, intensified the spirit of Poles who fought "For our freedom and yours" wherever they were. The end of the 1860s and the defeats of the national uprisings brought about the strengthening of the idea of positivism on Polish soil, included in the literature of Henryk Sienkiewicz or Bolesław Prus, aiming at organic work at the basis of the development of the Polish nation. The rise and development of Polish nationalism, based on the ideas of positivism and proclaiming the unification of Polish lands from all the partitions, strengthened both physically and materially the Polish nation in its aspiration for an independent state. The beginning of the 1890th brought modernism and neo-Romanticism to Poles, described as "Young Poland", expressed in the prose of Reymont, Żeromski or Wyspiański. This era strengthened expressionism, which gained a lot of attention, especially in socialist circles, which aimed at levelling social inequalities and overthrowing the reactionary order in Europe. The Polish society, which differed in its worldview, had one goal in common; this goal was to regain its statehood and the independence it would defend to the end. "Poland has not yet perished, So long as we still live.""
 POL_ruined_economy: "Ruined Economy"
 POL_ruined_economy_desc: "As a result of Great War activities that lasted at Polish lands for longer than in other countries, large areas often as a result of the plundering policy of the German and Austrian occupiers were ruined. Poland lost about 30% of national wealth during the war. Much about 40% of bridges and 60% of railway stations were destroyed. Industrial and agricultural production decreased considerably, due to the loss of pre-war outlets for domestic production and exports decreased."
 POL_political_instability_1: "Political Instability: §RUpcoming Revolution!§!"
 POL_political_instability_1_desc: "After defeat of the Central Powers, the situation in the Kingdom of Poland is extremely tense and complicated. The war and the destruction associated with it encourage society to adopt socialist and revolutionary proposals. The declaration of independence by the Regency Council and the departure of Governor-General Hans Beseler from the country did not change the attitude of the society towards the regents, who are marked by cooperation with the occupants. At that time, the socialists in Lublin formed the Provisional Government of the Republic of Poland and openly seek to overthrow the reactionary government in Warsaw. There are many centres of power in the country, moods are revolutionary and the Poles have not yet fully taken over the power in the country and there is already a possibility of civil war!"
 POL_political_instability_2: "Political Instability: Not Tolerated Socialist Cabinet"
 POL_political_instability_2_desc: "Despite the control of revolutionary moods, the current socialist cabinet is not tolerated by a large part of Polish society, which does not consider it as a common government of Poland. People with non-Leftist views do not want to pay taxes to the current government, do not agree with many of the reforms that the government announces and strive to establish a universal pro-Entente cabinet. The international situation in which the government finds itself is also to its detriment. Józef Piłsudski, known for his sympathies and influence in left-wing circles, and marked by his cooperation with the Central Powers, is difficult to accept by the Entente, which recognizes the Polish National Committee, residing in Paris, as the rightful government of Poland. One thing is certain, either there will be an inter-party agreement or the government will sooner or later be overthrown."
 POL_political_instability_3: "Political Instability: Relative Compromise"
 POL_political_instability_3_desc: "The conclusion of a compromise between Józef Piłsudski, the Warsaw government and the Polish National Committee in Paris, relaxed the tense atmosphere in the country. The quarrels at the very beginning of independence do not foster political stability or recognition by the victorious powers, which Poland urgently needs. The most important goal now is to hold elections to the Legislative Sejm and to adopt a Constitution that will create the legal basis for a reborn Poland."
