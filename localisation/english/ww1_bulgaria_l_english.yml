ww1_bulgaria.66.t:0 "Achievement of San Stefano"
ww1_bulgaria.66.d:0 "Through hard work and perseverance, we have regained control over the territories that once belonged to the Bulgarian state. This is a significant milestone in our history."

ww1_bulgaria.67.t:0 "Tobacco Surplus"
ww1_bulgaria.67.d:0 "Our bountiful tobacco harvest has led to a surplus, providing a boost to our economy and the well-being of our citizens."

ww1_bulgaria.68.a:0 "Empower the Tsar!"

ww1_bulgaria.69.t:0 "Turkish Opposition"
ww1_bulgaria.69.d:0 "The territories once held by the Ottoman Empire now stand under Bulgarian rule, yet the local Turkish population remains resistant. Tensions are rising, and it seems something must be done to address the opposition. Should we enforce harsher policies or attempt to offer autonomy to calm the region?"
ww1_bulgaria.69.a:0 "It's For Their Own Good!"
ww1_bulgaria.69.b:0 "Perhaps an Autonomous Thrace would be Beneficial?"

ww1_bulgaria.70.t:0 "Greek Opposition"
ww1_bulgaria.70.d:0 "The newly acquired territories that once belonged to Greece are proving troublesome. Greek nationals in these areas remain loyal to their homeland, refusing to fully integrate into Bulgaria. Their defiance might need to be quashed, or should we wait and hope their resistance will wane?"
ww1_bulgaria.70.a:0 "They'll Submit in Due Time"

ww1_bulgaria.71.t:0 "Ivan Geshov's Declaration on the Bulgarian Policy towards Turkey"
ww1_bulgaria.71.d:0 "Ivan Geshov:\n'Our policy is sincere, and as we are anxious that it should not prove the ephemeral policy of our Cabinet, but should become the permanent policy of Bulgaria, we hope that the neighbouring Empire will facilitate our task by responding to our invita-tion to eliminate the causes that are at the bottom of our misunderstandings; and the motives which irritate public opinion in our country. In a parlia-mentary country, no Government can march against public opinion. It will be a misfortune if our pacific policy fails under the pressure of public opinion for whose excitement we are in no way responsible. Where we fail, it is hardly likely that any other Bulgarian Government will succeed.'"
ww1_bulgaria.71.a:0 "Classic Pacifist Geshov"

ww1_bulgaria.72.t:0 "Ivan Geshov Comments on Relations with Turkey"
ww1_bulgaria.72.d:0 "'I have been asked by the Opposition to say on which side we are. My reply is that we are with those who sincerely wish for peace and who, as partisans of peace, favour those conditions without which peace cannot be maintained. These people think that the Balkan Peninsula ought to belong to the Balkan nations; they wish that whatever be the Balkan country where these nations live they should enjoy the blessings of freedom, justice, and constitutional rights. We are with those who are friends of this sort of peace. If the Turks desire such a peace, and can make peace such as we want it, then we are with the Turks also. Their neighbours for many centuries, connected with them by many economic ties, we are anxious to live with them on friendly terms. We are the more anxious to pursue this policy, because it is dictated to us by the vital interests of the Bulgarian, nation in the kingdom and outside its frontiers. Nothing has happened thus far to shake our confidence in this policy, or to undermine our hope that our neighbours also will realise their interest to observe the same friendly policy towards ourselves. We hope that, taught by past and recent trials, from which we wish them to emerge successfully, they will understand the need of introducing in their European provinces conditions of life which will induce our nationalists to stay where they are, instead of flocking to our territory. The present emigration means misery to the Bulgarian nation and causes harm to the Turkish Empire. It is in the interest of both countries to arrest this emigration which threatens Macedonia and Thrace with depopulation, and inundates some of our frontiers with restless and em- bittered elements, thus creating a Macedonian problem in our own midst. If conditions of life are introduced which shall put an end to a state of things so pregnant with dangers; if our repeated proofs of peaceful intentions are met with deeds that would satisfy some legitimate demands on our part, we maybe certain that a great step will have been made towards pacifying the provinces, inhabited by our co-nationalists. And no one wishes more passionately for such a pacification than the sober and industrious Bulgarian nation which, six weeks ago, met with such dignified calm the disquieting reports of a certain mobilisation along our southern frontier.'"

ww1_bulgaria.73.a:0 "Concerning Indeed..."

ww1_bulgaria.74.t:0 "Ivan Geshov Urgently Visits Vienna and Paris in Regards to the Italian invasion of Lybia"
ww1_bulgaria.74.d:0 "Ivan Geshov while in the respective cities talked to M. de Selves in France, and Count Aehrental in Austria. Geshov asked both the same two questions:\n1. Will the war be localized and short?\n2. Do they apprehend complications in Turkey, as the result of fanatical excitement, chauvinistic passions, or a movement against the Young Turks, followed by a counterrevolution like that of April 1909? \n\nBoth affirmed that the war will be localized and short; however, their answered differed on the second question. M. de Selves believes that Italy will consent to pay an indemnity for Tripoli. She may also recognise the suzerainty of the Sultan, but about this he was not so positive. At all events, he believes that Italy will show herself very conciliatory if the Turks begin negotiations immediately after Tripoli is occupied. M. de Selves also sympithazed with Geshov in his worries of Turkish aggression and proclaimed himself an admirer of the Tsar.\n\nCount Aehrental is of opinion that the Young Turkish Committee constitutes the only organised force in Turkey, that it will gain rather than lose by the present crisis, and that it possesses power enough to impose its will."

ww1_bulgaria.75.t:0 "The case of Mufti Afiz Suleymanov"
ww1_bulgaria.75.d:0 "In 1908 Afiz Suleymanov was appointed to replace Ali Halil Mehmedov the post of the Haskovo mufti. However; soon after his appointment several accusations came up such as corruption and mismanagment of several Mosques. Afiz Suleymanov referred to the complaints in a letter addressed to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Religion – he accused the former muftlik clerk Marko Avramov that he fabricated these slanders after the dismissal. In his defence, Afiz Suleymanov pointed out that there was a signature of the former mufti Smail Hadji Halilov on the petition from March 1908, despite the fact that he did not read the Bulgarian language and could not have approved the complaint. The Ministry decided that the mufti would keep his post.\n Afiz Suleymanov just recently won the 1910 Haskovo Mufti elections and like clockwork new accusations have emerged; which were linked to frauds during the appointing of the local mosque councillors. It was said that under the pressure of Afiz Suleymanov the county (okoliya) authorities ignored the official results of the election and designated the old councillors. Among them, there was Akif Eminov, a close friend of the mufti, who was both his secretary and cashier..."

This will not only boost Porto-Bulgarian releations but also helps cement our place in the world. Due to Portugals strategic location and colonies we could also develop a very good route to the Atlantic, and besides, us monarchies need to stick together in the age of revolution and reform."

ww1_bulgaria.77.d:0 "Recently our diplomats traveled to Lisbon to make contact with the new republic. They recieved a warm welcome even in the chaotic state of turbulence Portugal is in. They talked about many things but most importantly we officially recognize the new government and we were able to set the treaty of trade & navigation. This will not only boost Porto-Bulgarian releations but also helps cement our place in the world. Due to Portugals strategic location and colonies we could also develop a very good route to the Atlantic."

We've already made multiple breakthroughs with Bulgaria. We've acknowledged their independence and Ferdinand's position of king. Their new prime minister, Ivan Geshov, would like to continue negotiations. It could be quite worthwhile but we can surely expect Bulgaria to ask for more concessions..."

Wigand, engineer on the Salonica-Monastir railway line, that if the Young Turks were supported at the coming elections there would be no Christians left in Macedonia in 30-40 years.

Saafet chose to adopt a Slavic name, Ruska. The next day, her father, a hodzha, protested to the mayor along with other Muslims. They claimed their daughter had been abducted and was still underage (almost 16 years old) for marriage. On February 27, 1910, the court revoked the marriage permission and ordered Saafet to return to her parents. She went back to their house until the evening. That night, a crowd of “adventurers” gathered outside Saafet’s house intending to “rescue” her. The authorities moved her to a police station but couldn’t manage the approximately 1000 people, and Saafet eventually married Yordan on the 28th. Their wedding was celebrated by many in the central square, as it was the first Sunday before Lent, and a traditional fancy-dress carnival was held. The local police officer, who also attended the carnival, was mocked for failing to keep Saafet in the police station. Half an hour later, he called for cavalry support, and after some mutual verbal insults, a fight broke out between the citizens and the military. The clashes resulted in 24 deaths and about 70 injuries. Initially, the police tried to cover up the story by restricting communications to and from Ruse, but it soon became top news in newspapers across the country."

BUL_ruse_blood_wedding_ordeal_2_desc:0  "On February 24, 1910, Yordan Stefanov and Saafet received permission to marry from a doctor, as Saafet was deemed “mentally healthy” and claimed to be 18 years old. Saafet chose to adopt a Slavic name, Ruska. The next day, her father, a hodzha, protested to the mayor along with other Muslims. They claimed their daughter had been abducted and was still underage (almost 16 years old) for marriage. On February 27, 1910, the court revoked the marriage permission and ordered Saafet to return to her parents. She went back to their house until the evening. That night, a crowd of “adventurers” gathered outside Saafet’s house intending to “rescue” her. The authorities moved her to a police station but couldn’t manage the approximately 1000 people, and Saafet eventually married Yordan on the 28th. Their wedding was celebrated by many in the central square, as it was the first Sunday before Lent, and a traditional fancy-dress carnival was held.

BUL_peasantry_desc:0 "In the rural heartlands of Bulgaria, it is the peasantry, more specifically the cystic ‘peasantry,’ which remains the mainstay of the nation through times of economic repugnance and political upheaval. Deeply rooted in culture and more inclination to its soil, these diligent people contribute to the national food production. It is true that there is backwardness in terms of infrastructure development and technology. However, it is this will power that is most likely going to be the building block for the future of Bulgaria."
