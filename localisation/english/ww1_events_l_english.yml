 #Generic WW1
 ww1_generic.1.t: "Election of [GetYear]"
 ww1_generic.1.d: "[Root.GetNameDefCap] has held elections. Nearly everyone of voting qualification flocked to the polls, fueling the wheel of democracy for another few years, or at least until the next election. The current administration ensured the people that no voter fraud will occur under their watch, no matter the result. Then, the results hit the papers. \n\nThe winner of the electon has already delivered a speech to the masses gathered in the capital and is ready to accept the duties of the head of state, whatever they may entail during these turbulent times. The people cheer him on, but not all of them. Hopefully those who lost the election don't remain sore for long, for the sake of the state and the people."
 ww1_generic.1.a: "Congratulations to them."
 ww1_generic.2.t: "Pacifists Protest!"
 ww1_generic.2.d: "Our factories are empty. Our fields are too. You could hear a pin drop on the floor of our schools, for they are empty as well. The next sound you would hear is a voice just outside. A voice that rings out on the streets of the capital. A voice consisting of tens of thousands raised together in perfect cohesion. One word is on their tongues. \n\nPeace.\n\nNot all of these protesters are well-meaning, though. Socialists dot the crowd, stirring the pot, yelling radical slogans that the surrounding crowd soon adopts. Our ministers believe a call for revolution is next. We need these people back in the workforce, lest the war effort collapses. What to say to them, though, remains unknown. The pessimists in our administration believe there is nothing that can be said, and the worst is inevitable."
 ww1_generic.2.a: "It's all crashing down, isn't it."
 ww1_generic.3.t: "Strikes Across the Nation!"
 ww1_generic.3.d: "Dissatisfied with the present working conditions, disgruntled workers have organized and are marching across the nation. We simply can't deal with such a slowdown in our production, as our soldiers need a steady supply of equipment with little to no interruption. The leaders of these marches know this, and are demanding labor reform with the leverage they hold. Too much reform at a time like this though could be devastating even if we get all the workers back into their factories. We cannot possibly accept all of their demands, but what we can do is negotiate for ligher terms, hopefully to success. Another option is simply hoping it dies off. Lastly, we could send in the military police and show them what a real march is."
 ww1_generic.3.a: "They will tire soon, hopefully."
 ww1_generic.3.b: "The military police will take care of it."
 ww1_generic.3.c: "A little reform never hurt anyone."
 ww1_generic.4.t: "Victory for our Military Police!"
 ww1_generic.4.d: "The military police has dispersed the protests successfully. The blood that stains the streets is of much less importance than the hands that now work in the factories once again. Such a situation will hopefully never happen again, but now we know what to do in case things get rowdy. The war continues."
 ww1_generic.4.a: "We got lucky."
 ww1_generic.5.t: "Mass Riots!"
 ww1_generic.5.d: "Our attempts at breaking the resolve of the crowd has gone horribly! Even more workers are leaving their jobs now to counter the military police we deployed. The news is spreading like wildfire, and now everyone will soon know their government would rather resort to violence than negotiatate with their own civilians. Marches are turning to riots, and soon the blood that stains the street won't be just theirs, but ours too. The war effort is crumbling before our eyes, and most assuredly our enemy's eyes too."
 ww1_generic.5.a: "It's all falling apart!"
 ww1_generic.6.t: "[From.GetName] Killed in Action."
 ww1_generic.6.d: "A tragic event has occured today. [From.GetRank] [From.GetName] put [From.GetHerselfHimself] at risk while leading [From.GetHerHis] men. As a result, [From.GetSheHeCap] had been fatally wounded, passing away soon after. Our country won't forget [From.GetHerHis] sacrifice."
 ww1_generic.6.a: "[From.GetSheHeCap] served [From.GetHerHis] country well."
 ww1_generic.7.t: "[From.GetName] Dead from Disease."
 ww1_generic.7.d: "[From.GetName] couldn't recover from the affliction [From.GetSheHe] got while commanding [From.GetHerHis] troops, and ultimately passed away. Our country won't forget [From.GetHerHis] sacrifice."
 ww1_generic.8.d: "Victory. A word that we always sang of, but never knew for certain would arrive. Our diplomats have sent a telegram back to the capital saying that demands have been met, and the war is to end. The only thing left is our approval of the terms. The countless casualties will not be for nothing as long as we sign this peace. A radical idea though emerges from a few ministers: what if we continue? What if absolute victory can be achieved? The enemy is already on the retreat, they need only a push in the right direction. The choice, whatever it may be, lies before us. Let us consider carefully. \n\nIn this mod there is a truce that will establish a series of events which eventually distribute land based on claims and cores. Disabling the truce will affect the occuerence of events related to the consequences of the defeat of the opposing faction."
 ww1_generic.8.a: "Move forward with the truce."
 ww1_generic.8.b: "There will be no truce, only total victory!"
 ww1_generic.9.t: "A Disease Like No Other"
 ww1_generic.9.d: "The Influenza Epidemic has struck due to the unsanitary conditions in the trenches. We haven't been confronted with an pandemic of this size in hundreds of years, and we aren't nearly prepared enough to deal with it. There is a shortage of almost everything due to the demands of the war, meaning that the homefront will suffer all the more. Our greatest  scientists have begun to work earnestly in order to find some sort of solution, but progress isn't looking well.\n\nThe origin of the virus is unknown as of now, but we do know it's everywhere; especially the trenches. Our military cohesion has suffered to a degree making it nearly impossible to launch assaults on enemy trenches without retreating back simply due to the condition of our men. All attacks must be postponed or planned out to a degree that ensures victory, otherwise the price to pay may cost us everything."
 ww1_generic.9.a: "What cruel god would do such a thing?"
 ww1_generic.10.t: "Influenza Pandemic"
 ww1_generic.10.d: "The Influenza H1N1 virus is spreading like wildfire due to the terrible conditions in the trenches. The epidemic has infected thousands of soldiers already and is on its way to absolutely consume the batttlefield. The homefront has it worse, with astronomical infection rates and enough death to satisfy the devil.\n\nMaybe we are being punished for our hubris, maybe we shouldn't have played god over our fellow man. We mustn't linger on such things though as this crisis looms larger than anything else, perhaps even the war."
 ww1_generic.10.a: "This is a disaster!"
 ww1_generic.12.t: "Famine"
 ww1_generic.12.d: "Our granaries run dry, with our farmers unable to provide enough to refill them. These food shortages are taking the country by storm, dealing a heavy blow to homefront morale. Our economy can't stand the situation for much longer, and the total collapse of our agrarian sector will persist for the foreseeable future, as there aren't enough farmhands to prop things up. They are all either in the trenches or in the mud.."
 ww1_generic.12.a: "This isn't helping anything!"
 ww1_generic.13.t: "Great Martian War"
 ww1_generic.13.d: "Humanity is faced with an unknown enemy. Giant steel cars are descending from the heavens on the territory of Bohemia and have began to exterminate the local population. Neighboring states also reported that these alien entities have invaded their territory. Calls for an international effort to save their nations from desolation are being answered; humanity must be united against this menace."
 ww1_generic.13.a: "Fight for the survival of man!"
 ww1_generic.16.t: "Farm Crisis!"
 ww1_generic.16.d: "Deflation in product prices due to young men looking for work after the war has created mass poverty throughout rural areas. Our nation's top economists are coming up with solutions to manage this before it gets out of control, but the damage already dealt is enough to ensure the suffering of our rural population a forgone conclusion."
 ww1_generic.16.a: "Yet another consequence of the war."
 ww1_generic.17.t: "The Great Depression"
 ww1_generic.17.d: "The world feels like it's coming to an end. After a stock market crash, the likes of which never seen before, the global economy has collapsed to a degree in which nobody is spared. Banks are closing and citizens across the globe are being laid off, excaberating the crisis. Throngs of the recently unemployed crowd the streets of cities around the world. The industrial might of [USA.GetName] was particularly affected by the economic shock, being the center of it all.\n\nWe need to act now, as the situation can only get worse if we don't take the necessary steps to stabilize the economy. The coming years are going to be tough, extremely tough, but the resilience of [Root.GetNameDefCap] will carry us through."
 ww1_generic.17.a: "What a tragedy."
 ww1_generic.17.b: "This is the end for capitalism!"
 ww1_generic.18.t: "Great Depression in [ROOT.GetNameDef]"
 ww1_generic.18.d: "The aftermath of Black Thursday has reached our country. The inevitable shock of the event is doing much damage to our economy. Unless sufficient measures are taken, we will look not too dissimilar to the others this crisis has befell. It may already be too late..."
 ww1_generic.18.a: "We must stay strong."
 ww1_generic.19.t: "Bankruptcy of Factories"
 ww1_generic.19.d: "Some of our enterprises cannot cope with the economic pressure of the ongoing crisis. They can no longer pay their workers, as such they are declaring bankruptcy and shuttering their doors en masse."
 ww1_generic.19.a: "We can't do anything."
 ww1_generic.19.b: "Provide financial assistance."
 
 ww1_generic.21.t: "Fire at Military Factory"
 ww1_generic.21.d: "A large fire has broken out at one of our military factories. Massive parts of the building were completely destroyed. Restoring production will take a long time."
 ww1_generic.21.a: "This smells of foul play."
 ww1_generic.22.t: "Fire at Civilian Factory"
 ww1_generic.22.d: "A large fire has broken out at one of our civilian factories. assive parts of the building were completely destroyed. Restoring production will take a long time."
 ww1_generic.22.a: "This smells of foul play."

 ww1_generic.24.t: "Army Epidemic!"
 ww1_generic.24.influenza: "Influenza has stricken the army! Extremely unsanitary conditions on the frontline have created a large-scale epidemic in the trenches. No doubt this will erode our army's morale and strength as infected men struggle to fight under illness. The depravity of our situation has began to show itself."
 ww1_generic.24.fever: "Trench Fever has stricken the army! Extremely unsanitary conditions on the frontline have created a large-scale epidemic in the trenches. No doubt this will erode our army's morale and strength as infected men struggle to fight under illness. The depravity of our situation has began to show itself."
 ww1_generic.24.tetanus: "Tetanus has stricken the army! Extremely unsanitary conditions on the frontline have created a large-scale epidemic in the trenches. No doubt this will erode our army's morale and strength as infected men struggle to fight under illness. The depravity of our situation has began to show itself."
 ww1_generic.24.a: "This is a disaster.."
 ww1_generic.25.t: "Mass Desertion!"
 ww1_generic.25.d: "The army was swept by a wave of mass desertions. Soldiers are fleeing from their posts and running across the countryside, seeking anything but this wretched war. The longer we fight, the harder it becomes for soldiers to endure these insane conditions."
 ww1_generic.25.a: "We need to crack down on this."
 ww1_generic.26.t: "Fraternization with the Enemy!"
 ww1_generic.26.d: "Some of our military units have voluntarily ceased hostilities. It is getting increasingly difficult for soldiers and their commanders to endure this war and at the same time maintain their humanity, or what they have left of it. They seek a single respite in walking across the killing field and shaking the hand of their brother. While admirable, war is no time for fraternization. Such acts of comradery with the enemy undermine discipline and reduce our soldiers' willingness to support the state. Even through the immense gunfire, artillery shells, and rotting corpses that devastate the landscape, these men have broken the nationalist barrier that seperates them. They now see each other not as enemies, but as friends, nay, even the same. It is a shame that they will kill each other the next day anyways."
 ww1_generic.26.a: "Touching, but not to be tolerated."
 ww1_generic.27.t: "[FROM.GetName] denounces the truce"
 ww1_generic.27.d: "[FROM.GetLeader] no longer wishes to fulfill the terms of the armistice, imposed on them as a result of the Great War. This means that [FROM.GetName] can provoke a war or create alliances that can spark another great war."
 ww1_generic.27.a: "We literally just ended the war!"
 ww1_generic.28.t: "[FROM.GetName] denounces the army restrictions"
 ww1_generic.28.d: "[FROM.GetLeader] no longer wishes to fulfill the terms of the armistice, imposed on them as a result of the Great War. This means that [FROM.GetNameDef] can carry out rearmament and expand their nation's army."

 ww1_generic.29.t: "[FROM.GetName] asks to lift the rearmament restrictions"
 ww1_generic.29.d: "[FROM.GetLeader] has sent a diplomat bearing the request to lift the restrictions on their military production. It depends on us, the leader of our alliance, to take note of the risks and precedents this could set, and answer accordingly."
 ww1_generic.29.a: "Let them."
 ww1_generic.29.b: "We cannot risk another war."
 ww1_generic.30.t: "[FROM.GetName] allows us to rearm"
 ww1_generic.30.d: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] has agreed to lift the restrictions on our rearmament. After so much time, we will finally be able to develop our military."
 ww1_generic.30.a: "Great news!"
 ww1_generic.31.t: "[FROM.GetName] refuses to lift the restrictions"
 ww1_generic.31.d: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] has refused to accept our request for rearmament. We remain defenseless."
 ww1_generic.31.a: "Damn it.."
 ww1_generic.32.t: "[FROM.GetName] denounce army restrictions without our permission!"
 ww1_generic.32.d: "It seems as if our former enemies want to create a fighting force, without our permission! They have begun a large-scale rearmament, which grossly violates the terms of the [Root.GetIdeaArmisticeName]!"
 ww1_generic.32.b: "Punish them."
 ww1_generic.33.t: "[FROM.GetName] threatens to intervene!"
 ww1_generic.33.d: "Our efforts to rearm did not go unnoticed. [FROM.GetNameDefCap] has demanded we end our attempts at rearming and are preparing to invade our country. Get ready to resist the oppressive horde of our former enemies."
 ww1_generic.33.a: "Here we go again."
 ww1_generic.34.t: "[USA.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] Naval Treaty"
 ww1_generic.34.d: "It has been proposed that we sign a naval treaty to prevent a heated naval arms competition. All the great powers with imposing naval forces are invited to this treaty of disarmament."
 ww1_generic.34.a: "We can ensure a greater peace through signing."
 ww1_generic.34.b: "This navy is for our defence, we reject the treaty!"
 ww1_generic.34.b.tt: "§ROther powers will regard us as an enemy of world peace!§R"
 ww1_generic.35.t: "[From.GetNameDefCap] Demands Our Annexation"
 ww1_generic.35.d: "We have received a demand today from [From.GetLeader]. They have pushed a list of demands which would amount to our annexation. Our acceptance would result in no loss of life, avoiding a potentially devastating war, but our sovereignty would dissapate into the air. Agreeing to [From.GetLeader]'s proposal would make [Root.GetNameDef] a territory of [From.GetNameDef] and our government will be dissolved, replaced with a provincial management.\n\nThough we would rather not surrender our independence to a bully across the border, there's a definite threat in their message that leads us to believe that if we do not accept [From.GetLeader]'s demands, we will soon find ourselves in a state of war with [From.GetNameDef]."
 ww1_generic.35.a: "Submit to their demands."
 ww1_generic.35.b: "Absolutely not!"

 ww1_generic.36.d: "The [From.GetAdjective] government has agreed to abandon their independence and become annexed to [Root.GetNameDef]. We are sure this will lead to greatness and advance [Root.GetAdjective] interest in the region."
 ww1_generic.36.a: "Excellent."
 ww1_generic.37.t: "[From.GetNameDefCap] Remains Defiant!"
 ww1_generic.37.d: "Replies from [From.GetNameDef] indicated that they decline our offer to be annexed to [Root.GetNameDef]. Disappointing as it may be, the option to bring [From.GetNameDef] to heel by force remains a valid and tempting option."
 ww1_generic.37.a: "Disappointing."

 ww1_generic.105.t: "[FROM.GetName] embargoes us!"
 ww1_generic.105.d: "Because of our political vision now very different from that of the [FROM.getAdjective] government, the latter have decided to end all commercial relations. This is an embargo of all [ROOT.getAdjective] products within their economies. As a great power, [FROM.GetNameDef] heavily penalizes our economy."

 ww1_bruderkrieg.1.t: "Pan-Germanic Unrest"
 ww1_bruderkrieg.1.d: "[AUS.GetNameDefCap] has entered a state of great unrest due to the war with [GER.GetNameDef]. Her people are up in arms, but these are not the usual ethnic riots. These traitors are part of the ruling class, the Austrians. They are demanding the immediate end to the war, the splitting of the crowns, and the annexation of Austria to [GER.GetNameDef]. This Pan-Germanic uprising is a surprise to spectators around the world, who didn't realize that there was a yearning for a continued campaign of German Unification. It appears that 1871 did not mark the end of the Germanic people's quest for a united state. So Austria rises, and organizes to join their brothers once and for all."

But we still fight another day, and we reorganize for the next blow. The royal family and the government have evacuated to Transleithania, far from the front lines. No lives were lost amongst the remains of what was once a proud empire."

Never having had their own state, they were conquered by the Ottomans when they rampaged through the Balkans, and then annexed by Austria not too long ago.

Our government is observing this absurd and unprecedented situation with great concern, and with great interest. They have already swept through the Austrian portion of the empire and are poised to take Hungary. Talks among our ministers reveal that we can take this opportunity to push into Germany and take what was once ours. \nThe [AUS.GetAdjective] government has asked us to assist them and join the war, promising great territorial concessions.

This is a request rather than a demand, as they are not forcing us to submit and even if they did they are in no position to do so. We can also simply join a military alliance with them. Seperate, but joined in a common cause. Lastly, we must consider that we finally achieved our independence.

But the Germans keep winning battles, and keep moving forward, perhaps even reaching a goal of establishing their own hegemony in Central Europe. The [FRA.GetAdjective] Government hinted that they could intervene in the war if it goes on any more. They are no longer laughing, in fact they are a bit concerned.\nFrance may go to war against [GER.GetNameDef], but if they do it could spark a conflict that nobody wants, a war beyond all scale and knowledge we have.

The deal gave the Valona territory and areas of south-central Albania to Italy.\nThis deal created huge anti-Italian resentment among the Albanians, so much so that we have had to withdraw to important cities and their surrounding areas. This helped little, as our forces were engaged by the revolutionaries. Our own revolutionary movements in the homeland made having the Italian Army in Albania an impossiblility.\nThe Albanian-Italian protocol was signed, upon which we withdrew from Albania.

Too defensive, this plan considered that Germany would attack through Belgium in order to reach Paris quickly, while encircling part of our army through the operation of a war of movement. Thus, Victor-Constant Michel had recommended the movement of two thirds of the army to the Belgian border in order to anticipate such a situation.\n\nThe very conservative general staff immediately opposed this plan, describing the generalissimo as incompetent.

This system was revealed between 1904 and 1906 by officers unable to keep such a heavy secret. The affair caused a historic scandal throughout France, provoking indignation among the population, even on the left.\n\nFollowing this revelation, the government of Emile Combes collapsed and symbolic sentences were pronounced by the Rouvier cabinet which succeeded him.

He was quickly followed by Joseph Reinach. These new accusations allow us to accuse the left-wing governments of 1905 and 1910 of their discriminatory behavior. Revealing this new affair could cause a fatal blow to what remains of the left-wing cartel, while revealing the responsibility, once again, of Jewish, socialist and Freemason elites.\n\nOur contacts within the RP are linked to the world of newspapers, the cross for example.

Appointed during the reign of King Leopold II, the latter died in December 1909, leaving his new heir Albert I to take over.\n\nThe new sovereign therefore inherits a government that he does not approve of, his political vision being more different from that of his uncle.

 ww1_belgium.61.d: "During the debates in parliament, it became clear that there was no unanimous support for the Prime Minister's bill. Initially and in parallel with the discussions, the Belgian Education League lashed out, accusing such a reform of increasing the influence of the clergy on the country. Then, the project was seen as unfair, in particular because the subsidies were given according to the number of students, leading to overcrowding of classes. The law was therefore widely rejected and the King, who was totally against it, now has a grudge against Frans Schollaert."

 ww1_belgium.64.d: "Discussions with the United Kingdom have been underway since 1906 on the subject of Belgian national defense. If England wants to protect our nation, they also want us to sign a military pact with them.

 ww1_belgium.67.t: "1913 General Strike"
 ww1_belgium.67.d: "The Belgian workers' party POB has organized a huge nationwide strike to protest against the plurality voting system.

The demonstration spread throughout the country, particularly in the industrial sector of Wallonia. Well organized, the strike did not boil over and caused no deaths.\n\nAt the end of this strike, the government held firm and did not reform the voting system. The workers returned to work without obtaining any guarantee on this subject."

I have faith in our destinies. ».\n\nFrom the first hours of the conflict, he went as close as possible to the front to support the soldiers.

He specifies that the German army will then be a friend and will pay dearly for the damage caused by the war on the territory.

 ww1_belgium.73.d: "Since the begining of the war, King Albert has been extremely active in his royal prerogatives. Not only did he become a popular figure, but he also took control of much of the government's responsibilities. He represents the state, the army and the people without being burdened with ministerial countersignature. Frustrated, Prime Minister Charles de Broqueville is increasingly protesting Albert's authoritarian decisions, even though the latter remains very popular."

The “fear of red” also worked against liberals who were associated with moderate, but dangerous, socialists.

Destrée considers that these two identities are too different for the country to retain its current form and proposes administrative separation.\n\nBelgium would be made up of two autonomous entities, two different nations that would share a common king and common external politics.

However, this law risks costing the state budget dearly, which causes some hesitation on the part of deputies from our own camp. At the same time, the Catholic party has clearly announced itself against the bill, which leaves us in uncertainty as to the passage of our proposal.\n\nThe only reliable way to obtain the guarantee of the vote is to ally with the socialists of the POB, who propose a common vote in exchange for a few modifications which do not change the structure of the bill.

 ww1_greece.29.d: "Geórgios II succeeded, but the position of the monarchy remained precarious. The military-led Revolutionary Government tried and convicted six leading royalists to death as scapegoats for the country's military defeat, and gradually steered the country in the direction of a republic. The Revolutionary Government proclaimed elections to be held for a National Assembly which would decide on the country's future form of government. However, the government had passed an electoral law which heavily favoured the Venizelist Liberal Party and the other anti-monarchist parties. \nThe prospect of the elections and an almost-certain regime change led to the creation of a heterogeneous coalition in the ranks of the army, which aimed to overthrow the government. Its main driving force was the so-called "Majors' Organization" of royalist middle-ranking officers, which was in close contact with the royalist former Deputy Chief of the Army General Staff, General Ioannis Metaxas, but several disgruntled Venizelists, most prominently Leonardopoulos and Gargalidis, also joined. The conspirators managed to win over the bulk of the military units in northern Greece and the Peloponnese, but failed to make inroads in the garrisons of Athens, Thessaloniki or the other major cities, as well as in the overwhelmingly Venizelist Navy. \nIt was launched in the provinces in the early hours of today. In its initial stages it proved rapidly successful: by the morning, in the entire Greek mainland, only the cities of Athens, Thessaloniki, Larissa and Ioannina remained under government control."

 ww1_greece.52.d: "A disaster has come! The beautiful city of Thessaloniki has been burnt to the ground by a small accident that was started in a house by 2 Greek refugees. It was caused by a spark from a boiler for cleaning clothes with boiling water, which fell through a hole in the floor into an underground warehouse of straw. The lack of water and the ignorance of the neighbours did not make it possible to extinguish the initial fire and in a short time, due to the fierce Vardaris wind that happened to be blowing during those days, the fire spread to the neighboring houses and began to spread throughout Thessaloniki. Those affected by the fire were estimated at around 72,500, luckily with no one dead, but the fire destroyed 32% of the total area of Thessaloniki."

I was walking as a dead man without knowing where I was going. Suddenly by turning my head I saw behind me the King with his adjutant. I slowed my pace. The King walked by me, very close to me. I let him walk by me and immediately, I fired. ... I am not an anarchist, but socialist. I become a socialist, when I was studying medicine in Athens. I do not know how. One becomes a socialist, without realising it, slowly (one step at a time). All people that are good and educated are socialist. The philosophy towards medicine, for me it was the socialism."\n\nSome suggest Schinas may have committed suicide to avoid further gendarmerie "examinations" or a slow death from tuberculosis; others speculate that he was thrown from the window by the gendarmerie, perhaps to keep him quiet."

Phillipopoulos later broke down after the only response he received was "ok" "good" and many other one word answers.

The first to arrive on the scene were fishermen from Kea on their caïque, who picked many survivors from the water. At 10:00, HMS Scourge sighted the first lifeboats and 10 minutes later stopped and picked up 339 survivors. Armed boarding steamer HMS Heroic had arrived some minutes earlier and picked up 494.

HMS Foxhound arrived at 11:45 and, after sweeping the area, anchored in the small port at 13:00 to offer medical assistance and take on board the remaining survivors.

Violence broke out on 2 August, when crowds comprising around 5,000-20,000 people, led by local military veterans, looted and destroyed every visible Greek business in the city centre. Police forces in the area were reportedly overwhelmed and unable to stop the rioters, and instead stood by. Due to the scope of the violence, the mayor had to invoke the Riot Act to call in the militia and military police. The riot was the result of prejudice against new immigrants as well as the false belief that Greeks were not fighting in the Great War and held pro-German views."

The attack began during the night from three different sides and was well organized from the beginning.The armed groups broke into several dwellings and shot their inhabitants, irrespective of age and sex, while apart from the killings, several rapes also occurred. The surviving civilian population ran to the harbor and tried to escape by boat. Due to the general disorder, some people were drowned while trying to swim in order to save themselves. The Ottoman authorities tried to cover up the incident. However, after two days a French steam tug boat arrived at Smyrna and spread the news about the massacre. The crew had observed a large number of people on the promontory and sent ca. 700 survivors to the nearby Greek island of Lesbos. The Greek authorities there rescued the remaining 6,000 inhabitants by sending boats to bring them to the island."

Also politicians who Cen Chunxuan leads, after the destruction of Empire of China, are giving pressure to government to restore the Provisional Constitution of the Republic of China and enact a decent new constitution for the Republic.\nSo here we are on the crossroad. If we agree with republicans, start to elect provincial governor by civil election and enact provincial constitution, their discontent will be radically reduced and there could be a peace, but this must enforce Beiyang Clique to be weaken hard. But if we drag some centralists convincing them that the republicans who demand to restore the Constitution are contradictory to provincial autonomy and centralism and seems not that much in unanimity, we can get much more power to the central government from the National Assembly.

He also noted that he doesn't doubt the strength of the hull, but the design bureau is obliged to ensure adequate safety on such a large ship.\n\n The White Star Line company has already announced a new era of transatlantic passenger traffic, in which one of the largest Olympic-class ships will be used at the moment."

His health was continously in decline since the beginnning of the year but he had pushed through with his duties, rarely taking a pause, until the very last moment. His smoking habbits certainly didn't help with his health and he was already suffering from cancer in 1907, which was cured by Radium. He was the longest serving Prince of Wales, a British title for heir apparent, and while his rule was relatively brief, especially compared to the rule of his mother, his rule would still be marked as Edwardian Era, as he was a very respected monarch. His son George Frederick Ernst Albert would take the throne in the following days, taking up the regnal name of George V."

Asquith, to step down. \n\nThe fall of Asquith as Prime Minister split the Liberal Party into two factions: those who supported him and those who supported the coalition government. In his War Memoirs, Lloyd George compared himself with Asquith:\n\n\n"There are certain indispensable qualities essential to the Chief Minister of the Crown in a great war. . . . Such a minister must have courage, composure, and judgment. All this Mr. Asquith possessed in a superlative degree. . . . But a war minister must also have vision, imagination and initiative—he must show untiring assiduity, must exercise constant oversight and supervision of every sphere of war activity, must possess driving force to energize this activity, must be in continuous consultation with experts, official and unofficial, as to the best means of utilising the resources of the country in conjunction with the Allies for the achievement of victory.

 ww1_england.41.t: "To Centralise or not to Centralise?"
 ww1_england.41.d: "That is the question.\n\n\nOswald Mosley has been chairman of the Trade Union Congress for some time now, and his time has seen a radical increase in authoritarian tactics and the emergence of a cult of personality. It has also been noted that Mosley is becoming increasingly more aligned with Mussolini's new ideology of Fascism, which he sees as the true proponent of the working class. Ultimately, he must make a choice:\n\nOpenly side with fascism and lead the nation into glory, or halt the centralisation process and continue rule as Chairman?"

The ILP had long been unwilling to merge forces with a doctrinaire Marxist organization such as the SDF, however, and unity negotiations had reached an impasse. Finally, as the decade of the 1910s dawned, there seemed to be some interest in the topic among the rank and file of the ILP, and the 1910 Annual Conference of the SDF had decided to try again in earnest.\n\nThe BSP, contains a multiplicity of views and was organized as a loose federation of clubs and branches rather than as a centralised and disciplined party.\n\nLeading members of the former SDF, led by the party's patriarch, H. M. Hyndman, rapidly took control of the new organisation. This leading group advocates that the BSP place an emphasis on electoral politics and the effort to capture the state through the ballot box rather than through labour agitation, the formation of trade unions, and pursuit of an extra-parliamentary route to power via the strike movement."

His body will likely never be recovered.\n\nThe news of Kitchener's death has been received with shock all over the British Empire. A man in Yorkshire committed suicide at the news; a sergeant on the Western Front was heard to exclaim "Now we’ve lost the war. Now we’ve lost the war"; and a nurse wrote home to her family that she knew Britain would win as long as Kitchener lived, and now that he was gone: "How awful it is - a far worse blow than many German victories. So long as he was with us we knew even if things were gloomy that his guiding hand was at the helm."\n\nThe King has ordered army officers to wear black armbands for a week."

 ww1_england.121.d: "Since the end of the London Crisis, Britain has been ruled by a military clique and its autocratic monarch. It has operated with limited democracy, with parliament working to a semi extent, with military officers having a guaranteed majority in the House of Commons. However, enough time has passed with Charles III, Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha on the throne to ask the question of what is to be done with this 'provisional' system of government. With being educated in Germany, Charles is enthusiastic about the principal of applying the Prussian System to his homeland, although such a thing may be slightly unpopular with a few of the military officers who have benefited from the dictatorship."

 ww1_england.123.d: "His breathing was sharp and ragged, he struggled to focus his vision as explosions and gunfire pelted in the distance. Looking down, Henry Tandey constituted himself and gathered his bearings. A soldier of the 5th Duke Of Wellington's Regiment, Tandey was a war-hero and a recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest possible award in the British Army.\n\nAs he steadied himself, he looked up. The unmistakeable Feld-Grau of a German uniform. A worn stahlhelm. It was a German soldier. But something was off. Tandey raised his rifle, but hesistated to fire when the enemy didn't reciprocate this action. He was wounded. Staggering through the mud and ruins of the village. He barely looked like he was going to survive the day.\n\nAll this blood, all this chaos. Not this time, Tandey thought to himself. Just this once, just this one time, he would let him go. He would allow the German to return to his lines. What would be the point, Tandey thought. He was no threat. He was just a wounded German.\n\nThe German nodded his head in acknowledgement and respect, and quickly left Henry's view. The noble war-hero had saved another life.\n\n\nThe German soldier was a young man known as Corporal Adolf Hitler."

 ww1_england.131.d: "Despite all signs pointing to a colonial war in South Africa, diplomacy has once again saved the day.\n\nAfter deliberations from both Britain and Portugal, the possible war has been averted following a backing down of British forces.

The current garrison is only strong enough to protect one of these areas, given the constant harrassment from revolutionaries, and if we don't choose right then the road to Guyana will be left wide open.

 ww1_england.148.d: "Disaster! The Afro-American militias have successfully seized Guyana, our last major base in the Carribbean!

 ww1_england.156.d: "While the British were not the first to make use of heavier-than-air military aircraft, the RAF is the world's oldest independent air force: that is, the first air force to become independent of army or navy control. Following publication of the "Smuts report" prepared by Jan Smuts the RAF was founded on 1 April 1918, with headquarters located in the former Hotel Cecil, during the Great War, by the amalgamation of the Royal Flying Corps (RFC) and the Royal Naval Air Service (RNAS). At that time it was the largest air force in the world. After the war, the service was drastically cut and its inter-war years were relatively quiet, with the RAF taking responsibility for the control of Iraq and executing a number of minor actions in other parts of the British Empire. The RAF's naval aviation branch, the Fleet Air Arm, was founded in 1924 but handed over to Admiralty control on 24 May 1939."

 ww1_england.175.b: "We're actually a little different."
 ww1_england.176.t: "The Formation of the Internationale"
 ww1_england.176.d: "The Third International was founded that is targeting the socialist state of the world as a transitional stage of the overthrow of the bourgeoisie and complete elimination of the state, including armed forces by all possible means."

 ww1_england.178.t: "The British Revolution and the Great Escape of the Royalists"
 ww1_england.178.d: "The Socialists and Republicans caused the revolution in Britain, and the almost whole states were quickly joined. The royalists didn't even have a chance to fight properly, and they managed too evacuated only the British royalities and few armies. The Republic was once again established in Britain."
 ww1_england.178.a: "Look at those fleeing reactionaries!"
 ww1_england.178.b: "A very unfortunate situation is happened."
 ww1_england.179.t: "A New President?"
 ww1_england.179.d: "After securing the future of the Republic, Edward Pease has begun to consider retirement. A slew of candidates stand out to replace him;\n\nH. G. Wells, noted author of the War Of the Worlds, stands as a committed and well-respected socialist who would stand true to the ideals of the party. However, he is an outspoken anti-imperialist and is in favour of decolonisation, which doesn't sit well with the majority of our parliament.\n\nGeorge Lansbury has fought hard for our female comrades, and is a stirling example of progressive, socialist policy. However, he is a steadfast pacifist, and our role in any imminent conflicts could be stunted as a result.\n\nOf course, Pease has no obligation to resign, and could just fulfill his full term as president."
 ww1_england.179.a: "Pease remains, after all!"

 ww1_england.180.t: "The Future of the Republic"
 ww1_england.180.d: "After securing the Republic forever from Monarchist Counterrevolutionaries, Pease has begun to consider delegating more duties to his faithful protege, Henry Hydeman. Hydeman helped direct the policies of the Vanguard, and made the ideology of Communism mainstream in British politics. We owe a lot to Hydeman, and he would be a committed revolutionary."
 ww1_england.180.a: "I see no need to retire just yet."
 ww1_england.180.b: "Hydeman will make an excellent President."
 ww1_england.181.t: "Death of Henry Hyndman"
 ww1_england.181.d: "Henry Hyndman, President of the Republic of Britain, has died aged 79.\n\nHis legacy is... mixed. While he valiantly took the torch from Comrade Pease and led the revolution against the capitalists, his means of doing so were highly authoritarian and his most fervant critics (who have long sinced exiled themselves for their own safety) accuse him of being objectively worse than the government that preceded him. Nevertheless, the torch passes on once again, and Harry Pollitt has now been inaugerated as the Third President of the Republic.\n\nPollitt promises a process of 'DeHyndmanisation', and a significant lowering of the autocratic rule, however he is otherwise unremarkable."
 ww1_england.181.a: "Will Pollitt truly end the Reign of Terror?"
 ww1_england.182.t: "Two-Power Standard Activated"
 ww1_england.182.d: "Reports from Naval Intelligence suggest another nation has surpassed our Two-Power Standard!\n\nAs per the Naval Defence Act 1889, the Royal Navy must be at least twice the size of the combined force of the two navies behind it.\n\nAs per the act, funds will be immediately diverted to naval production."

 ww1_england.184.c: "How about a genuine coalition?"
 ww1_england.185.t: "The 1923 Election"
 ww1_england.185.d: "Due to the unstable political situation, another election has had to be called barely a year after the last one.\n\nIn Britain's chaotic political climate, the Liberals have just managed to claw their way out of death. By no means in any place to form a government, they captured enough seats to cause a Hung Parliament, and both parties will be forced to woo them for support."
 ww1_england.185.a: "Asquith will try to sap Labour's voterbase"

 ww1_england.186.d: "The Third Election in two years, the [GetYear] Election should finally put an end to the political turmoil.

 ww1_england.186.a: "Landslide Tory Victory."
 ww1_england.187.t: "Motion of No-Confidence"
 ww1_england.187.d: "The Liberal-Labour Coalition arose out of Asquith's attempts to sap the voterbase of the Labour Party. He wanted to prove Labour to be incompetent, and to capture all their voters as a result. This backfired. Seeing no other alternative, the Liberals called a motion of no confidence against the Labour Party.\n\nThere are only two choices. Call a Snap Election with a guaranteed loss to the Tories, but at heavy cost to the liberals, or try to save face and just let the Liberals form a coalition with the Tories."
 ww1_england.187.a: "Fuck Asquith, that treacherous little snake. Call the election!"

 ww1_england.188.d: "After the end of the Great War, Prime Minister [ENG.GetLeader] has called a general election. It is likely that he will remain in power, despite the Liberal Party losing their majority.... That is, unless the Conservatives feel like breaking the Coalition Ticket"

 ww1_england.188.b: "We have the electoral mandate, so why not?"
 ww1_england.189.t: "The Southwest Africa Question"
 ww1_england.189.d: "Capturing Southwest Africa from the Germans means one important thing- inheriting the legacy of the Herero Genocide. The Herero people were viciously brutalised by the German regime in the early 1900s in what many are calling 'the first Genocide of the Century', and while most colonial administrations agree the area belongs under British control there are those who sympathise with the tribe and believe we should award it to them."

 ww1_england.193.t: "Liberal Defections Intensify"
 ww1_england.193.d: "We are very rapidly losing our majority in Parliament, as MPs begin to cross the floor in droves to join the [ENG.GetCommunistParty]. Furthermore, in Local government across the country, our councillors and mayors are also leaving for the socialists. We cannot hold this much longer- at this rate, it won't be long until we lose our majority completely."

 ww1_england.194.d: "Following multiple scandals and, more importantly, the tide of defections of Liberals to the [ENG.GetCommunistParty], a vote of no confidence has been called in [ENG.GetLeader] and the Liberal Majority has fallen. For now, the socialists still lack a majority to form a government, but it's only a matter of time now.\n\nNevertheless, the giant of politics of the Liberal Party has fallen."

 ww1_england.196.t: "The Treacherous Cabinet"
 ww1_england.196.d: "Unbeknownst to the Lord-Protector, a plot had been forming against him. The plotters had their various reasons; concern for the people of Britain, belief that Kitchener had gone mad, or just plain old ambition. But when Kitchener called them all into the office to announce that they would be sent all over the world as part of a grand plan for World Domination, they had had enough.\n\nSuddenly, the plotters attacked Kitchener and his supporters. The fight was tough, and both sides' guards and entourages also got involved.\n\nEventually, most of the Pro-Kitchener officers had escaped... except for Kitchener himself. He now found himself surrounded by the plotters, who each would take turns taking the life out of the old man, bit by bit..."

 ww1_england.198.d: "Following the death of the Lord-Protector, several various cliques have begun to arise in Britain, all plotting against each other.\n\nThe Militarists are split into two factions, the Pro-Coup and the Anti-Coup. The Pro-Coup Militarists want to undo a large portion of Kitchener's reforms, and halt his plans for global domination. The Anti-Coup Militarists, all rallying behind Edmund Allenby, seek to continue Kitchener's reign and prepare for the grand conquests.\n\nThe Civilianists, nominally lead by Winston Churchill, are allied with the Anti-Coup Militarists and effectively call for the resuming of Kitchener's policies but under a Civilian government. Many are comparing their policies to the new ideology of 'fascism' which has cropped up in Europe recently.\n\nThe Restorationists believe that the end of Kitchener's regency justifies the restoration of the rightful King, Prince David, to the throne."

 ww1_england.201.d: "Scotland has always been the region that had the least love for Lord-Protector Kitchener, so when his assassination became known it was met with apathy and in some regions even outright joy. It is no surprise then that the Pro-Coup Militarists, angry at their inability to take control of the whole union, have fled to Scotland where they enjoy some degree of support.\n\nThey seem to have unified under Admiral John Jellicoe, and must be dealt with swiftly."

 ww1_england.204.d: "With our grip on London now firmly implanted, the question of leadership now comes into play. Following the death of Lord-Protector Kitchener, Prime Minister Henry Page Croft took over as interim leader. However, Winston Churchill is concerned that Croft may merge the offices of Prime Minister and Lord-Protector, giving himself a practically dictatorial role in government. For this reason, he has decided to run against Croft."

 ww1_england.206.t: "A Question of Leadership"
 ww1_england.206.d: "Within the Pro-Coup faction, two main figures have come to dominate. John Jellicoe, admiral in the Royal Navy, is the defacto moderate candidate, opposing Kitchener's rule for pragmatic and moral reasons as he sees no need for further bloodshed and seeks to focus more on the people of Britain. Douglas Haig on the other hand sees no issue with hard, strong and jingoistic rule, but loathed Kitchener because of his policies regarding officer commissions and the aristocracy, which hampered the rise of Haig and his friends."

There is something we can do about him, however.\n\nKitchener is nominally the Commissioner-General of [EGY.GetNameDef]. If we increase his duties there, and force him to relocate to the country, he will become increasingly disconnected from the establishment here in London.

The Liberal Party's platform of social reform, including old-age pensions and the progressive taxation system, now stands on the brink of full implementation. With the backing of King George V, Asquith's government is poised to introduce significant political changes that could reshape the relationship between the House of Commons and the House of Lords."

Despite fierce competition from the Liberals, the Tories have secured enough seats to form a government, marking a turning point in British politics. Their victory reflects widespread opposition to the Liberals' radical social reforms, including the controversial People's Budget and the push for Irish Home Rule. The Conservatives, who rallied around the defense of the House of Lords and traditional institutions, now find themselves tasked with addressing the ongoing constitutional crisis. As the country looks ahead, Balfour's government will seek to maintain stability, defend the British Empire, and uphold the monarchy's influence against further Liberal reforms."

Their first attempt to attack the Republic was undertaken about an year ago, but their incursion was successfully and miserably crushed by republican garrison.\nBut this time, the royalists divided into three groups have attacked Chaves, the northernmost of Portugal. Early in the engagement, the defenders, led by Augusto Ribeiro de Carvalho, misjudged the enemy's route, but when they heard that the enemies had gathered near Chaves, they returned and were able to simply destroy the enemies with artillery fire from the hills.

However, the North has also been the traditional seat of the Portuguese nobility.\nTaking advantage of the turmoil caused by President Sidónio Pais' assassination and replacement, Henrique Paiva Couceiro quickly made his way to North of Portugal, where he assessed that the setting was conducive to the restoration of the monarchy, to meet with the monarchist central command. The Integralismo Lusitano Central Junta met, where António Maria de Sousa Sardinha and Luís Carlos de Lima e Almeida Braga decided to proceed with Paiva Couceiro's plan of taking Porto, with the intention was to cut-off Porto from Lisbon and thereby foster unanimity for a restoration of the Portuguese monarchy.\nAlthough António Sardinha and Paiva Couceiro marched into Porto, without any resistance from local military or citizens, on the morning, it was not until the following day (after a military parade) that a formal ceremony that included the hoisting of the blue and white royal flag proclaimed the Monarchy of the North. Following the proclamation of the restoration of the monarchy, the blue and white flag was hoisted at government buildings throughout the North."

They made their local proclamation of the Monarchy and hoist the monarchy flag. The republican citizen militia gather in Eduardo VII Park and, along with some members of the National Republican Guard, the Fiscal Guard, and of the military and navy, marched towards Monsanto.

He was accompanied by his brother and his son, planning to take the train to Porto.\n\nInside the station, the left-wing activist José Júlio da Costa was waiting for him, concealing a pistol in his Alentejo cloak. When the President passed the assassin on the first floor of Rossio station, Da Costa penetrated the double police cordon that surrounded the President and fired two shots from the pistol hidden under his cloak. Luckly, one of the police grabbed his coat and pushed him to the floor when the first shot fired.  Pais immediately evacuated without any injure, and a panic broke out. During the confusion, four innocent bystanders were fatally wounded by the guards; the assassin, who didn't try to escape, was arrested after being brutally beaten by the crowd. Pais himself escaped the assassination attempt, and with bolstered security made his way to Coimbra to meet with the de Castro Junta a few days later."

Military crackdowns with loyal units quickly eroded the brief popularity Sidonio enjoyed, and with the economic situation continuing to spiral opposition began to seriously radicalise. Pais refused to step down however, and repeatedly cited he was the only man who could save the republic.\n\nBut on today, Sidonio Pais was shot by an anarchist several times outside the Congress, despite a heavy security presence. The President-King has been killed within minutes, and with him the Republic has begin to fall."

Unable to resist, the government of António Granjo handed its resignation to President [ROOT.GetLeader]. Yet, as night fell, Portugal was still without a government as President [ROOT.GetLeader] resisted appointing the government the rebels wanted.\nAs night fell, the radical soldiers assassinated Prime Minister Granjo and multiple other ministers, with a "ghost truck", led by Abel Olímpio, roamed Lisbon with the aim of murdering a list of notable people. The riot appeared to have targeted Sidonist politicians, except for Granjo. The coup ultimately failed, but Portugal devolved into chaos."

The world is experiencing the largest crisis in the last 100 years, and one that will topple the old order and bring about a new age of existence. This war is to be known as the Great War, and the war to end all wars, as this conflict has shattered the Concert of Europe which kept Europe from fighting a major war ever since the Napoleonic Wars. This conflict, decades in the making, is the result of decades of political tension between the established great powers of Europe and their different goals and ambitions. But no matter, millions of men are now drafted and forced to fight in the absolute horror of the trenches, fathers and sons of every nation dying side by side, as brothers."

The people of Russia find themselves questioning whether or not the Tsar could lead the country to victory, with such a large city falling to enemy forces. This defeat has provoked a series of Anti-German pogroms in Russian cities and huge wave of deportations of Jews from the Pale of Settlement, as the Russian command feared that the Germans would try to use these lands to agitate people who were dissatisfied with Tsarist Russian rule."

Rebels now lay siege to the capital and the Sultan himself is now entrapped in the siege - without external aid from a colonial power, it is guaranteed the Sultan’s reign will soon be cut short.\n\nHence, as a desperate attempt to keep his position, the Sultan has sent a plea to the French general Moinier who is garrisoned in Casablanca to free the city from the rebel besiegement. However, the consequences of this are that it is without a doubt that the French (with the pretext of protecting the European peoples who conduct business in Morocco) will seize further control of Morrocco and attempt to bring our country into its empire.\n\nThe people of Morocco have long been disheartened with the rule of a French puppet for a Sultan, therefore, with the threat of becoming what would be little more than a French puppet, perhaps it is time for Morocco to fight for its right to self-determination, lest our name become a stain on their history books.

As the coalition's life duration was already extended past all due points, it was only a matter of time for this experiment to fail, especially considering the calming of the region. While independent radicals expect new elections as it should've happened in 1908, the radical party has a relatively comfortable majority in parliament and can form a homogenous government. As the king refused to give the mandate to Pašić again, a homogenous government will be formed by Milovan Milovanović, the former foreign minister that will be merging his role with prime minister one for the duration of his mandate..."

Therefore they stopped supporting the government and were thus kicked out of the party. But with them leaving Radical Party is left in very dangerous situation, as they are one deputy short of majority, having 79 deputies in support of the government out of 160 deputies in parliament total. We can expect motion of no confidence at any point from now on and only our prime minister's actions in placating the opposition parties can prolong the government's mandate in this situation of lost majority, and with alliance with Bulgaria in formation, government crash is the last thing we need."

He was the foreign minister in most of the recent governments and his biggest life achievement he will never see come into fruition. As Nikola Pašić is in Russia right now and had already announced that he has no desire to take over government right now, Milija will be replaced by his interior minister Marko Trifković who vowed to uphold his legacy and make his project to it's fullest potential by liberating the Balkans, either he or his successor.

We expect that most of the government will follow suite in the next weeks.

The failures of the previous government, the disappointment regarding alliance with Bulgaria and of Annexation Crisis where Radical government lost Bosnia for the foreseable future contributed greatly to the Radical party's fail in these elections. As expected Stojanović has already expressed the need to deal with eastern neighbour and to fix the multiple problems that plagued recent Radical governments.

He will be replaced with more hardliner radical party member, Stojan Protić who will merge his roles of finance minister and prime minister for the duration of his mandate.

Namely, a deputy from the People's Radical Party, Nikola Uzunović, brought a gun inside parliament. During a heated discussion in the parliament, once he was about to speak, while a opposition deputy was finishing his speech and he was waiting for his turn, he brought out a gun, shot at the deputy who was finishing his speech and then shot in the direction of the opposition benches in parliament. \nThe epilogue of the event is few of the Independent Radical deputies were heavily wounded and the speaker was killed on the spot. The deputy disappeared from the parliament but tomorrow he surrendered to the minister of the police, Stojan Protić. \nThe opposition left the parliament and will not return for the foreseable future, increasing the crisis with obstruction of the parliament. While they are waiting for the recovery of their members and mourn up their lost members, the motives of the attack are unknown as the deputy Uzunović refuses to speak. However, a lot of people blame the increasing political tensions in the government, along with the recent purges of the military and the increase of the power of the regent as his father decided to retire from throne."

The regent had, with allegedly heavy heart, dismissed the entire government with the prime minister Pašić in tow, and as interim government posted a known radical, Stojan Protić, hoping that the political crisis would cool down with time and with Pašić out of the picture."

After two hours of listening to the list of his crimes, they were executed in front of the already dug up graves. \nWhile the controversy of the trial is well known to everyone, for now it would be the public secret.

 ww1_serbia.56.d: "Earlier this week, a group of Montenegrin royalist rebels from the former True People's party along with some remnants of the Montenegrin People's army, attacked our positions in  Montenegrin mountains in an ill-fated attempt to restore an independent Montenegrin kingdom under king Nikola I. They proclaimed the Grand National Assembly of Serbian People in Montenegro as illegitimate and called for the return of the deposed king Nikola I to his rightful place in the Montenegrin throne. The rebels, commonly known as Zelenaši (Greens), under the leadership of former Montenegrin officer Krsto Popović, attempted to attack the positions of Serbian Royal army in the Montenegrin cities, attacking from the mountains, but were repulsed by Royal Serbian army and it's volunteer allies which go under the name of Bjelaši (Whites). The ill-fated uprising ended with our victory, with the leaders of the uprising getting prison sentences of various durations. \nWhile the uprising was a failure for the rival Montenegrin government in Italy, it proved that the decision of the Podgorica Assembly wasn't completely unanimous and that the opposition from a part of Montenegrin population exists. We have to be careful in the future regarding similar events..."

 ww1_serbia.57.d: "King Petar I had, after short illness, passed away in his sleep yesterday, surrounded by his family and few doctors. He got a heavy lung infection from which he didn't manage to recover. \nHe was a leader, a soldier, a king, a revolutionary in his own way, not too far away from Karađorđe himself. Petar had been fighting for the Serbia's liberation long before he became the ruler. He fought in Bosnia during the uprising using the name Petar Mrkonjić, to avoid being recognized. He served French Foreign legion successfuly for 5 years. When he returned to Serbia, he recognized the liberal constitution, being the first Serbian monarch who was fully committed to democratic values, and very rarely used his remaining powers to intervene in the democratic process. He was the reason Serbian democracy succeeded and thrived, despite Serbia being relatively undeveloped nation, surpasing other major European nations in the freedom ratings. \nHe was a great army commander, having commanded Serbian army through both Balkan wars. And even after retirement, he was still available for both the regent and the government for advice from his lasting experience in both civilian and military affairs. His death marks an end of an era, while his successor [SER.GetNeutralLeader] claims that he will do everything in his ability to uphold the legacy of the late king, the population knows that the new monarch would have to be different from the old king."

 ww1_serbia.58.d: "Earlier this week, a number of arrests was made against the suspected members of the Black Hand, on the crimes of the betrayal of the nation, warmongering against foreign powers, conspiring against Serbian interests, theft of weapons and it's smuggling towards Austria. A short investigation produced a handful of proofs of the weapon smuggling, and raiding of the Apis' apartment led the investigators to the list of the Black Hand members, which were subsequently arrested. The court martial was held against all of them, with almost every member of the Black Hand receiving guilty verdict. \nWhile foreign spectators consider this event as a classic show trial in dictatorial fashion, there was no doubt that the organisation planned a murder of some high ranking officials. The extended investigation showed a proof towards the Black Hand members intending to murder even crown prince Aleksandar and his brother Đorđe. With king Petar's approval, all of the conspirators were sentenced to death, with most of them having the sentence commuted to life in prison. \nWhile Entente powers look at the trial with disdain, our northern and western neighbour has commended us for the trial, and with many of the conspirators receiving prison sentence or firing squad, the Black Hand has been finally eradicated from our society. \nWith the purge of Black Hand, other officers sympathetic to the Black Hand cause and even the apolitical ones are beginning to stir up, expecting the purge's ire to be turned against them too. With many of the officers already dissatisfied with the ruling regime, especially the ones that fought in the Balkan wars, we can expect a increase of mutinies, disobedience in the military and similar. We can only hope that their influence is low enough for us to not worry about it."

 ww1_spain.2.d: "Along with the defeat of Annual against Riffian tribesmen in Spain’s Moroccan Protectorate, Spain was dominated by a desire for regeneration. Following the defeat at Annual, the Spanish parliament inquired into assigning responsibility for the loss. Right before Primo de Rivera took over, the results of this inquiry were going to be released to the public, and they implicated many high-ranking military officials. This exacerbated the deteriorating relationship between the politicians and the military, who felt the politicians were to blame. The military at first planned to install a new government led by General Francisco Aguilera, president of the Supreme Council of Military Justice, but they ultimately chose Primo de Rivera to lead this new government.\nPrimo de Rivera staged a successful coup d’état in Barcelona in the mould of 19th-century pronunciamientos. With the army's support, he ousted the parliamentary government of Manuel García Prieto. Primo de Rivera stated he would create a temporary government to save Spain from the corrupt politicians that had been mismanaging it since 1898. Shortly after, on 14 September, King Alfonso XIII declared his support for Primo de Rivera's coup and dismissed the civilian government, suspending the 1876 Spanish constitution. He made Primo de Rivera the head of a new Military Directory, with powers to propose "whatever decrees are convenient" to the king."

He created the National Assembly, where corporate interests were represented rather than voters' individual interests. Groups such as the UP, the Church, and the army were represented in the National Assembly, along with local governments and various economic organisations. Primo de Rivera also decreed that the military officials still holding government positions must return to their military duties, and civil governors were appointed to replace them. With the creation of the Civil Directory, Primo de Rivera rejected returning to a parliamentary system, as promised, and oriented towards a long-term rule for his dictatorship."

 ww1_spain.4.t: "Primo de Rivera Resigns"
 ww1_spain.4.d: "The economic struggles of [GetYear] and the dictatorship's failure to stabilise the value of the peseta were large hits to its reputation. Primo de Rivera failed to establish political legitimacy for his rule. The 1876 constitution was suspended when he came to power, and the new constitution created by the National Assembly was rejected by the monarchists, liberals, and republicans. The army also had grievances with Primo de Rivera and his dictatorship. These complaints mainly came from members of Spain's artillery corps, whom Primo de Rivera suspended. As the king saw Primo de Rivera lose support among the army, he could no longer support Primo de Rivera's dictatorship, and Primo de Rivera resigned today ending his dictatorship."

Every other Arab country has generic content, but undead and space dolphin are working on something for a very important Arab country, so wish them luck.

In the first version, the incident began by a Greek soldier running after his dog, which had strayed across the border from Greece at the pass Demir Kapia on Belasitsa (Belles). It is has been now called by some politicians as "The War of the Stray Dog". The border was guarded by Bulgarian sentries, one of whom shot the Greek soldier. In the second version, the incident was caused by Bulgarian soldiers, who crossed the Greek border, attacked a Greek outpost at Belasitsa and killed a Greek captain and a sentry. This has resulted in an open conflict between Greece and Bulgaria and it is unclear how it will proceed."

ww1_greece.235.d: "After our army bravely captured Preveza and its port, it salvaged two Ottoman scuttled torpedo boats, Tokad and Antalya, in the Amvrakikos Gulf. These two ships were built by the Italian company Ansaldo in 1906, and will be refloated to be re-used in the Royal Hellenic Navy, with the names of Tatoi and Nikopolis."
ww1_greece.235.a: "A grand addition to our navy!"

ww1_greece.236.d: "After many years of war, we have come out on the winning side, and it appears that after longs discussions in the peace conferrences the Austrians will cede 6 Fiume-Class destroyers as war reparations from the Great War. We are going to refit them to the Hellenic Navy and rename them to the new territories we have recently acquired!"
ww1_greece.236.a: "Do the Austrians even have a coast anymore?"

ww1_greece.237.t: "A Republic Declared in Northern Epirus!"
ww1_greece.237.desc: "After Greece was forced to evacuate the region of Northern Epirus under international pressure, following the terms of the Treaty of London, the local Greeks in the area feeling betrayed from the Greek government, took advantage of the instability in Albania and proclaimed their own government. With local conflicts already being reported between Greek irregular bands and the Albanian gendarmerie, the future of the area is nothing but certain."

ww1_greece.238.t: "An offer of peace..."
ww1_greece.238.d: "After only a very short time of our participation in the Great War, the Entente are willing to negotiate a special peace treaty with us, allowing us to keep the claimed territory we have occupied during the war, in exchange for sending them war reparation for the damage we've caused. Although this may seem like a good offer, diplomats have pointed that Greece may be exploited economically and geopolitically as a result of this peace deal."
ww1_greece.238.a: "A rather good offer."

ww1_greece.239.t: "Panagis Koutalianos has passed away"
ww1_greece.239.d: "Panagis Koutalianos, also known as Panagis Antoniou has passed away today at his home in Constantinople at the age of 69. He was a famous Greek wrestler at the end of the previous century, around his life circulating many legends and traditions. Originally a sailor by profession, he learned wrestling, where, due to his great muscular strength, he initially did matches and demonstrations in many ports. He fought almost all over the world, tradition says he never lost a single fight. In many games he wore the skin of a tiger, which, according to tradition, had strangled in a fight. He has also defeated a puma in Brazil with his bare hands along with bulls in the USA, and less notably, having pulled a ship's anchor at the age of 19."

ww1_greece.240.t: "Earthquake and Tsunami hits Lefkada!"
ww1_greece.240.d: "On Thursday, November 27, 1914, a strong earthquake measuring 6.3 on the Richter scale hit Lefkada. It was yet another heated episode in the perpetual and steady collision between the Eurasian and African plates, which, pushed by the Earth's rotation around itself, are colliding over the Ionian Trench off Kefalonia, Lefkada and Kythera. \n\nThe earthquake hit the western side of the island more, specifically the villages of Athani, Dragano, Diamilianoi, Hortata, Komilio, Exanthia, Kalamitsi and Tsoukalades. Residents in the villages of Hortata, Athani and Dragano were forced to spend the night in the countryside, because almost all the houses in the specific settlements had collapsed. The fact that the loss of human life did not exceed 16 dead allows us to assume that the earthquake struck during the day, when many were outside their homes. In the settlements of Vassiliki, Vournika, Karya, Egluvi and Lazarata, the houses suffered serious damage, while minor damage was caused in the villages of Agios Petros, Syvros, Agios Ilias, Poros, Vaukeri, Drymonas, Pigadisanoi, Pinakochori, Karyotes, Katuna and Kalligoni. In the city of Lefkada, more than 500 houses were damaged, mainly in its coastal part. The earthquake created cracks in the ground 30 cm wide, up to one meter deep and 3 km long on the road that connects the city of Lefkada with Agios Nikitas. \n\nThe tsunami that was created after the earthquake was two to three meters high, being one of the biggest that has hit areas of Greece in the last hundred years. \n\nThe prefect of Corfu Mr. Ypsilantis sent a telegram to the engineer Vergianitis informing him that he had procured 100,000 tiles for the restoration of the houses that had been damaged and in which the needy were housed. In his letter, the prefect requests that sailing ships be sent to him, in order to transport the tiles to Lefkada."

ww1_greece.241.t: "Renaming Dedeagats?"
ww1_greece.241.d: "After many years of foreign rule, Western Thrace, a muslim majority territory with a rather large Greek minority has fallen into our hands through the conquests of the hellenic army. A small issue has arised, and that is the naming of the former capital of the Sanjak of Dedeağaç, with the capital bearing the same name. The local citizens of the small fishing village have suggested, along with the Metropolitan, that the city gets renamed to Neapolis, the "New City" as it is the most recently acquired Greek territory. Others, especially holding seats of local governance have suggested that we keep the current name to avoid any tensions, while others have suggested other names."
ww1_greece.241.a: "We will keep the current name."

ww1_greece.242.d: "War has broken out once again in the Balkans, and, after 15 years of our humiliating defeat in the Greco-Turkish War of 1897, we shall reclaim what always belonged to Hellas. Even though we are allied with the Bulgarians - for now - we strictly agreed in our ascension to the Balkan League that the territory that is captured by both parties in the war will be ceded in the peace conference. Therefore, we and the Bulgarians are at a race for Thessaloniki, Solun as they call it, the second largest port of the Ottoman Empire and of great strategic importance. Even though the Bulgarians are the so called "Prussia of the Balkans" we will prove them wrong, as we did in the Macedonian struggle, and as they have greatly underestimated our army!"
ww1_greece.242.a: "I Makedonía eínai Ellinikí!"

ww1_greece.243.t: "Thessalonica in Greek Hands!"
ww1_greece.243.d: "Reports have been recently received that as of this morning, the Ottoman port of Thessalonica has been captured by the invading Greek army. Even though the original target for the Hellenic Army was the village of Bitola, the Greek prime minister soon realised that Bulgarians would capture Thessalonica first, and gave the order to Field Marshal Prince Constantine, capturing the city first. With the outnumbered Ottoman Army fighting a rearguard action against well-prepared Greek forces at Yenidje, Bulgarian troops advancing close by, and the Ottoman naval base at Thessalonica blockaded by the Greek Navy, General Hasan Tahsin Pasha soon realised that it had become untenable to defend the city. The sinking of the Ottoman ironclad Feth-i Bülend in Thessaloniki harbour on October 1912, although militarily negligible, further damaged Ottoman morale. As both Greece and Bulgaria wanted Thessalonica, the Ottoman garrison of the city entered negotiations with both armies. The Bulgarian army arrived one day after the surrender of the city to Greece and Hasan Tahsin Pasha, commander of the city's defences, told the Bulgarian officials that "I have only one Thessaloniki, which I have surrendered"."

ww1_greece.244.d: "Reports have been recently received that as of this morning, the Ottoman port of Thessalonica has been captured by the invading Bulgarian army. The Bulgarian Army, taking advantage of the Greek loss in the Battle of Yenidje, have advanced with nearly one hundred thousand men south of Kilkis and have captured Thessalonica, after a fierce battle. General Stoyanov Todorov, commanding the army that entered Thessalonica, encountered the Ottoman army of Tahsin Pasha that was trying to execute a last stand defending the city after battling the Greeks in Yenidje. The Bulgarians scored an important victory against the Ottomans north of Thessalonica, but gave enough time to the Greek army to reorganize and renew an offensive towards the important port. As both Greece and Bulgaria wanted Thessalonica, the Ottoman garrison of the city entered negotiations with both armies. The Greek army arrived one day after the surrender of the city to Bulgaria and Hasan Tahsin Pasha, commander of the city's defences, told the Greek officials that "I have only one Thessaloniki, which I have surrendered"."

ww1_greece.245.t: "Thessaloniki has been liberated!"
ww1_greece.245.d: "Although there was a small confusion in the high command whether to advance in Bitola or Thessaloniki, after scoring a decisive victory in Yenidje we advanced swiftly in Thessaloniki with no resistance. The commander of the city's defences, Hasan Tahsin Pasha, has unconditionally surrendered the city to us, and after 5 centuries of Ottoman rule, the Symprotévousa of Byzantium is once again in Greek hands. Despite the Bulgarians having issued their complaints and demanding that they're allowed to march in the city, we will still organize our festivities. Our King, George I, will soon visit the city. What could go wrong?"
ww1_greece.245.a: "Constantinople is next."

ww1_greece.246.t: "Thessaloniki falls to Bulgaria..."
ww1_greece.246.d: "Even though our initial offenses seemed successful, we were blocked in the Axios river and suffered many defeats with even more casualties. Our defeat in the Battle of Yenidje prevented us from advancing in any direction in the Macedonian theater, North, West or East, only South into our retreat, and gave the Bulgarians enough time to make significant advances. Thus, Thessaloniki fell to the advancing Bulgarian Army shortly after, with our army entering the outskirts of the city 1 day later. This is a signicant loss to us, and someone is certainly responsible for this disaster!"

Starting from the Romanian front, Drozdovsky's forces traversed Moldavia, crossed Ukraine, and passed through the volatile regions of the Don and the Volga.

 ww1_sra.2.d: "The Volunteer Army, a key force in the fight against the Bolsheviks, has extended a proposal for unification. This offer comes at a time when our situation is increasingly precarious. Facing the formidable Soviet Army, it is becoming evident that our chances of success, when standing alone, are slim. Unification with the Volunteer Army presents a practical, albeit difficult, choice. It offers a chance to bolster our strength and present a united front against the Bolshevik threat, but it also means sacrificing some of our autonomy and traditional ways."

With Pokrovsky's forces now integrated, our Volunteer Army's strength has effectively doubled, presenting us with new strategic opportunities.

 # Liechtenstein
 ww1_liechtenstein.1.t:0 "Beck Putsch"
 ww1_liechtenstein.1.d:0 "Wilhelm Beck, Fritz Walser and Martin Ritter today tabled a motion of no confidence in the Landtag against the incumbent governor, Leopold Freiherr von Imhof. This follows growing calls for a Liechtensteiner head of government (Imhof is Austrian) and his poor management of the various embargoes imposed on Liechtenstein.\n\nAlthough we remained neutral during the Great War, our country suffered severe food shortages as a result of our customs union with Austria-Hungary, causing the Entente to become suspicious of our neutrality and embargo us. As the war progressed, the situation became more desperate as food supplies from Austria-Hungary ceased and the Entente put pressure on Switzerland to embargo us as well. Although Imhof set up emergency commissions throughout the country to manage the procurement of food and raw materials and their distribution to the population, he was accused of inadequacy and incompetence in dealing with the economic crisis. This allowed politicians such as Whilhelm Beck to gain prominence and growing support for his social-liberal ideals. Supported by Martin Ritter and Fritz Walser, he called for an expansion of the welfare state, broader voting rights and a Liechtensteiner head of government.\n\nFollowing heated debates in the Landtag, Imhof agreed to submit his resignation, but asked for a vote of confidence. The princely appointed members of the Landtag unanimously supported Imhof, but this didn't stop the elected members from voting to transfer power from the governor to a provisional executive committee led by Martin Ritter. While this coup directly undermines the 1862 Constitution of Liechtenstein, its leader has no intention of breaking with the monarchy, and his proclamation itself ends with the phrase ''May the Prince and the country live long''."

The group stormed the Landtag during a session and forced both appointed and elected officials to sign their petition, which proclaims [LIE.GetLeader] to be the legal successor of the Holy Roman Imperial Throne and reclaims all former territories of the Empire. [LIE.GetLeader] has yet to make a statement regarding this coup. If he declines the position, it would effectively render the coup illegitimate and force the Freikorps to step down."

 ww1_liechtenstein.7.d:0 "Today, Wilhelm Beck, Fritz Walser, and Martin Ritter moved to oust Governor Leopold Freiherr von Imhof from Liechtenstein's Landtag, citing his Austrian background and mismanagement of embargoes during food shortages. Imhof's response was inadequate, bolstering support for Beck's social-liberal agenda. Even though supported by princely elected members of the Landtag, Imhof offered to resign, leading elected members to transfer power to Martin Ritter's Provisional Executive Committee, challenging the constitution. The Trio affirmed their loyalty to the monarchy, ending their proclamation with ''May the Prince and the country live long.''"

Fearful of Wilhelm Beck launching another democratic takeover, the Freikorps stormed the Landtag during a session, coercing both appointed and elected officials into signing a petition. The petition declares [LIE.GetLeader] as the legal successor to the Holy Roman Imperial Throne and lays claim to all former territories of the Empire. This bold proclamation has been widely dismissed as illegitimate by most nations. Meanwhile, [LIE.GetLeader] has remained largely silent on his new "imperial" status, with reports suggesting the so-called "Emperor" is quite confused by the entire situation."

In order to restore our prestige, the Kaiser is insistent that we open negotiations with the French in order to gain colonial concessions from them as per the initial invitation from the French foreign minister Joseph Caillaux.\n\nHowever, before we extend an offer to the French it should be first decided what our actual aims are - most of the foreign and colonial offices agree that we should rescind any claims in Morocco in exchange for the French Congo, however, we could push for control of southern Morocco, reparations from the French or perhaps we can convince the French to return Morocco to its pre-crisis state.

 ww1_san_marino.1.d: "San Marino had been close to a civil war in, with Socialist red forces on one side, and Christian Democratic white forces on the opposite side together with the Conservatives. The situation was so explosive that the government introduced a six-month censorship, and called a carabinieri garrison to restore order, while Fascist brigades from Italy entered San Marino without invitation. The old Council was forcibly disbanded by Italy, and a snap election was consequently called. Fascist threats obtained their goal: the Socialist Party did not take part to the election and a sole, centre-right list called Patriotic Bloc ran undisputed. The Bloc was obviously dominated by the Sammarinese Fascist Party, which obtained the majority of seats together with their puppets Volunteers of War. The turnout was very low, with leftist electors boycotting the vote.\nTwenty-nine year old Giuliano Gozi became the first Fascist Captain Regent. The party political program was to dismantle all democratic reforms of the Meeting of 1906, and to emulate the Italian regime."
