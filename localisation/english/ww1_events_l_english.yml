Although their country is different, they shared the spirit of Christmas. Then the Germans began to put Christmas trees decorated with candles and light fixtures over the trenches, and a German soldier plucked up the courage and climbed out of the trenches with a small Christmas tree. Normally, getting out of the trenches without any cover was like committing suicide, but no one shot him.\nNumerous soldiers from both sides climbed out of the trenches unarmed. Eventually, facing each others making two lines confronted, they shook hands, hugged and chatted, and befriended with each other sharing Christmas gifts, small souvenirs such as military insignia, rank insignia, their uniform caps, and simple items such as food, alcohol, and cigarettes. Most of the officers who watched the soldiers' extreme deviant behavior joined, met the officer of the other side, signed a gentleman’s agreement, and agreed not to engage in combat for the time being. Also, the dead bodies in the no man’s land that were difficult to recover were able to be properly retrieved."

The gas, heavier than air, sank into trenches dug in the ground, where the soldiers were exposed to the agent and had no choice but to be killed in excruciating pain.\nNow, the task of countries joined the Great War is to figure out how to protect their soldiers from this damned gas attack, using method such as gasmask, how to keep them on the frontline without heavy casualties, and to quickly have the means to launch a massive gas attack on their enemy."

Some call it a landship because it looks like a battleship moving on land, while others call it an armored tractor because it is an armored and uses tracks to move. But some call it a tank because it looks like a metal chariot that is to be filled something.\nMilitary reports describe these armored vehicles as being equipped with engines, cannons and machine guns, and moving very slowly, but no damage with infantry weapons. And there are a handful of military experts who predict that in the future this weapon will be a game-changer for warfare.

However, the government had passed an electoral law which heavily favoured the Venizelist Liberal Party and the other anti-monarchist parties. \nThe prospect of the elections and an almost-certain regime change led to the creation of a heterogeneous coalition in the ranks of the army, which aimed to overthrow the government. Its main driving force was the so-called "Majors' Organization" of royalist middle-ranking officers, which was in close contact with the royalist former Deputy Chief of the Army General Staff, General Ioannis Metaxas, but several disgruntled Venizelists, most prominently Leonardopoulos and Gargalidis, also joined. The conspirators managed to win over the bulk of the military units in northern Greece and the Peloponnese, but failed to make inroads in the garrisons of Athens, Thessaloniki or the other major cities, as well as in the overwhelmingly Venizelist Navy. \nIt was launched in the provinces in the early hours of today.

This was further stimulated by the Zaydi political concept, by which they were encouraged to rise up as imams against an unjust ruler as part of their religious duty, hence the periodic uprisings against the Ottomans.\n\nSecret negotiations were initiated in June 1911 between Imam Yahya, the spiritual and temporal leader of the Zaydi branch of Shi'a Islam who has been leading periodic uprisings against Ottoman rule in the highlands of Yemen since 1905, and Ahmed Izzet Pasha, the new Ottoman wali and commander-in-chief of Yemen.\n\nIn the years when he had been chief of the Ottoman general staff, Izzet Pasha had proposed as a solution to the costly military stalemate in Yemen that the mountainous regions inhabited by the Zaydis be left to their effective control while Turkey would retain the coastal regions, the Tihamah, leaving only a token garrison in Sanaa.

It is a complex issue that involves not only money, but also the unstable political situation in here and the intervention of foreign powers. The railroads, which do exist, are operated privately rather than owned by the state, and the new cabinet determines that nationalization of railroads is a priority in order to solve the national problem. The idea is that if railroads are nationalized, we will be able to receive loans with that from foreign powers to immediately finance the reforms. \nHowever, since the private capital invested in railways is invested by the Chinese people from all walks of life, not by a few capitalists, the backlash from the nationalization measures is expected to be very strong. Also, it is a risky measure because there is virtually no guarantee that the bonds given to them during forced nationalization will guarantee the property they will lose."

Their first attempt to attack the Republic was undertaken about an year ago, but their incursion was successfully and miserably crushed by republican garrison.\nBut this time, the royalists divided into three groups have attacked Chaves, the northernmost of Portugal. Early in the engagement, the defenders, led by Augusto Ribeiro de Carvalho, misjudged the enemy's route, but when they heard that the enemies had gathered near Chaves, they returned and were able to simply destroy the enemies with artillery fire from the hills. The militia that had gathered to defend the Republic while the regular soldiers were absent played a important role in the defense of the city."

However, the North has also been the traditional seat of the Portuguese nobility.\nTaking advantage of the turmoil caused by President Sidónio Pais' assassination and replacement, Henrique Paiva Couceiro quickly made his way to North of Portugal, where he assessed that the setting was conducive to the restoration of the monarchy, to meet with the monarchist central command. The Integralismo Lusitano Central Junta met, where António Maria de Sousa Sardinha and Luís Carlos de Lima e Almeida Braga decided to proceed with Paiva Couceiro's plan of taking Porto, with the intention was to cut-off Porto from Lisbon and thereby foster unanimity for a restoration of the Portuguese monarchy.\nAlthough António Sardinha and Paiva Couceiro marched into Porto, without any resistance from local military or citizens, on the morning, it was not until the following day (after a military parade) that a formal ceremony that included the hoisting of the blue and white royal flag proclaimed the Monarchy of the North. Following the proclamation of the restoration of the monarchy, the blue and white flag was hoisted at government buildings throughout the North."

When the President passed the assassin on the first floor of Rossio station, Da Costa penetrated the double police cordon that surrounded the President and fired two shots from the pistol hidden under his cloak. Luckly, one of the police grabbed his coat and pushed him to the floor when the first shot fired.  Pais immediately evacuated without any injure, and a panic broke out. During the confusion, four innocent bystanders were fatally wounded by the guards; the assassin, who didn't try to escape, was arrested after being brutally beaten by the crowd.

This conflict, decades in the making, is the result of decades of political tension between the established great powers of Europe and their different goals and ambitions. But no matter, millions of men are now drafted and forced to fight in the absolute horror of the trenches, fathers and sons of every nation dying side by side, as brothers."

Meanwhile, the Soviet of Workers’ and Soldiers' Deputies is being formed in Petrograd, also aspiring to become the dominant power in Russia.

Following the defeat at Annual, the Spanish parliament inquired into assigning responsibility for the loss. Right before Primo de Rivera took over, the results of this inquiry were going to be released to the public, and they implicated many high-ranking military officials. This exacerbated the deteriorating relationship between the politicians and the military, who felt the politicians were to blame. The military at first planned to install a new government led by General Francisco Aguilera, president of the Supreme Council of Military Justice, but they ultimately chose Primo de Rivera to lead this new government.\nPrimo de Rivera staged a successful coup d’état in Barcelona in the mould of 19th-century pronunciamientos. With the army's support, he ousted the parliamentary government of Manuel García Prieto. Primo de Rivera stated he would create a temporary government to save Spain from the corrupt politicians that had been mismanaging it since 1898. Shortly after, on 14 September, King Alfonso XIII declared his support for Primo de Rivera's coup and dismissed the civilian government, suspending the 1876 Spanish constitution.
