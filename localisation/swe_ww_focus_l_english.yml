He delivered the following speech to the gathered protestors;\n\n"Ye honest men of Sweden's yeomanry tribe!\nYe have come to speak Your opinion regarding the maintenance of the realm and the care for its highness. Ye are here with me to make known to all, that no demand is too high and no burden too heavy, when it comes to the preservation of our ancient freedom and the safeguarding of our future development.\nFrom times so distant, held hidden in times immemorial, the foundation of this realm has rested on the firm and unshakably welded trust between king and people.\nI shall, in accordance with My duty as Your king, seek to show You the way to reach our goal in common. Follow and support Me henceforth!"\n\nThis has made rebounds in Swedish politics."

 ww_sverige.1.d:0 "With Liberala samlingspartiet securing a strong position in Riksdagen, there are many positions that need to be filled. Currently the question of Defense Minister is put forward and discussed, with Liberala samlingspartiet wishing to appoint a civil minister to the position rather than a military man. It is very clear however that the conservative members of Riksdagen, the King himself and the military would likely see this as an attempt to undermine their position and may make them more likely to try and undermine our regime.\n\nHowever backing down would undoubtedly hurt our position as well."

 ww_sverige.10.t:0 "A New Government"
 ww_sverige.10.d:0 "After the failure of the last liberal government and their resignation following Bondetåget, there is now a need to appoint a new government. So far there are two choices for government seem to be a \"borggårdsregering\" under Hammarskjöld, who is considered a principled and steadfast choice and a government under Ernst Trygger who has long been favored by the king but is known for his anti-parlimentary mindset who is seen more like an attackdog under the king by most. In particular Arvid Lindman, who is head of the right in the second chamber of government has voiced concern about him as a choice."

 ww_sverige.101.d:0 "While Gustaf V was able to convince Riksdagen to accept Ernst Trygger as new head of government, it is clear that he isn't a very popular choice. With his blatant opposition to Parliamentalism many on the left see him as a threat to democracy, meanwhile Arvid Lindman has personally refused to take part in a government led by Ernst Trygger however has for the time being not taken a stance of being an active opponent to the regime. This is mostly out of concern that infighting could lead to the rise of a leftist government."

This meeting has occurred in outmost secrecy, while other members of the military have become aware of the coup and are awaiting the go-ahead of the king the air is tense.\nMany are worried that some outrage may be sparked by this course of action and that younger officers who are more loyal to the unions may try and oppose this course of action and that revolutionary elements may jump at this as an excuse to overthrow the monarchy but Sven Hedin has claimed that if this is not done the future of Sweden may be uncertain."

This was fully supported by the King and the Riksdag, beyond a few stray Riksdagsmembers who abstained from voting."

The order repeatedly spread and by the evening it had been fully sent out. Alltogether 3800 men arrived and showed great enthusiasm and willingness to follow the mobilization order.

He also had wished for the King to make another statement in which he retracts what was said under Bondetåget and in the future consult with the head of government (or relevant minister) before making public political statements. Karl Staaff made it clear should the king decline to this, he and the government would resign.\n\nWhile this conversation was held behind closed doors, the King responded publicly, explaining the propositions made by Staaff and dismissing them as insolent. Further he explained he wouldn't go along with it since he didn't want to give up his right to freely speak on his opinions to the people of Sweden.\n\nIn response the government resigned."
