With the Maxim Gun now not only fabricated, but on a large scale, we simply have no choice but to get with the times. The quicker we bring these new weapons into circulation, and bring in experts who know how to use them, the quicker our military can become a modern, effective fighting force."

 ww1_trenchwarfare:0 "Trench Warfare Focus"
 ww1_trenchwarfare_desc:0 "Since Gatling and Maxim introduced their unholy weapons of warfare, our nation has been keenly interested in strategies based around the defense of Trench lines, which were first seen as far back as the American Civil War. We must seek experts in this theory in order to advance our knowledge in tomorrow's Land Doctrines."

 ww1_artillery_effort_1:0 "Artillery Effort"
 ww1_artillery_effort_1_desc:0 "One step to expand our young military modernization program is further development of our Artillery batteries. Seeking out designers for new weapons is a logical first step, and once our project is completed, we expect to reap the benefits of an easily-designed new Artillery piece."

 ww1_artillery_effort_2:0 "Artillery Effort II"
 ww1_artillery_effort_2_desc:0 "Now that we have gathered some accomplished Artillery designers, it seems logical to support their endeavors with their own factories. By assigning these men as full-time designers and engineers, and putting workers under them, we can easily make advancements in the field of Artillery."

 ww1_artillery_effort_3:0 "Artillery Effort III"
 ww1_artillery_effort_3_desc:0 "Field tests are proving a major issue with our artillery pieces: The wide variety of calibers we're using for various ranges and models of Artillery is proving a costly endeavor, and reducing the effectiveness of our pieces on the field. By enforcing a few standard sizes for our guns, we can produce new models of Artillery that give us, quite literally, more bang for our buck."

 ww1_artillery_effort_4:0 "Artillery Effort IV"
 ww1_artillery_effort_4_desc:0 "Though the direct-fire Field Gun was thought to be on its way out from the battlefield, our quartermasters are actually beginning to request even more of these pieces. Focusing our efforts on new direct-fire guns, and perhaps more types of rounds, will not only inevitably lead to superior models, but perhaps lead to some unexpected advantages elsewhere as well..."

 ww1_special_forces:0 "Special Forces Focus"
 ww1_special_forces_desc:0 "Chemical Warfare has, by sheer accident, introduced us to a class of excellent troops, superior to the other groups in our army. These men seem quite useful to act as classes of Infantry which are above the caliber of the standard Rifleman. Seeking out these men could lead to a boost to our special forces. If only there were some way to get them into battle faster..."

 ww1_army_motorization_focus:0 "Motorization Focus"
 ww1_army_motorization_focus_desc:0 "Some of our geniuses in the General Staff- or perhaps just men fed up with the stalemates of Trench Wafare- have proposed mass-producing vehicles specifically for troop transportation, which would allow our men to get to and from battlefields faster- and, perhaps, around it as well. Of course, even this simple act requires specific equipment and training, which means an investment- though one that could easily pay off."

 ww1_doctrine_effort_1:0 "Doctrine Effort I"
 ww1_doctrine_effort_1_desc:0 "Though the era of the General Staff consisting of the princes of the realm has long ended, several of our Generals and other officers were chosen for our armeis not for skill, but for connections or family ties. Though this keeps them loyal, it makes them uncompetitive. We must begin appointments for merit- though still, hopefully, not let too much of the common riff-raff into the esteemed General Staff..."

 ww1_doctrine_effort_2:0 "Doctrine Effort II"
 ww1_doctrine_effort_2_desc:0 "Though our General Staff has now been made thoroughly merit-based, they aren't the only ones who can assist in our doctrines. A type of researchers who have been mostly dormant since the early 1800s- ''armchair generals''- have organized once again. Though these men have limited combat experience, their study in war cannot be ignored. Integrating them could prove beneficial for our military tactics."

 ww1_doctrine_effort_3:0 "Doctrine Effort III"
 ww1_doctrine_effort_3_desc:0 "One of our critical elements of warfare has largely been ignored prior: Logistics. For troops to be useful in combat, we must ensure they arrive on time, and have, at least, food, water, and a weapon.

 ww1_equipment_effort_2_desc:0 "Our new Quartermasters have taken to us with requests for not simply newer rifles, but newer support weapons as well.

 ww1_equipment_effort_3_desc:0 "The Quartermasters have sent a letter of demands for more rifles equipped for the conditions of trenches- those able to launch rifle grenades, attach bayonets or scopes, and more carbines. Though we could simply produce more straight up, it seems like a logical move is to bring our rifles to the standard of being able to do all of these things- which means a new, improved design."

 ww1_equipment_effort_4:0 "Equipment Effort IV"
 ww1_equipment_effort_4_desc:0 "Our Quartermasters have, unfortunately, sent us yet another list of demands. Luckily, we have instructed our postmasters to ignore any further mail from them. Their last demand is new equipment for our Engineer corps- Carbines, tools, and those new Flamethrowers, which will be commissioned as soon as possible. Of course, expanding the Engineer corps as such could provide for some unseen benefits..."

 ww1_armor_effort_1:0 "Armor Effort"
 ww1_armor_effort_1_desc:0 "Our prior investments have paid off! Artillery designers, Engineers, and vehicle designers have proposed to us a brand new type of vehicle- a heavily armored tractor with a direct fire gun. Though early designs are clearly not battle ready, this concept has strong promise- particularly in the field of ending the Trench stalemate in our favor, if these landships can stand up to machine gun fire, as is claimed."

 ww1_armor_effort_2:0 "Armor Effort II"
 ww1_armor_effort_2_desc:0 "Our experiments with armor have been a rousing success! However, we cannot be complacent with our current designs. Engineers have been proposing interesting concepts like rotating gun turrets, specific engine compartments, and a hatch for use by a commander, which cannot be ignored. If we are to be the first to make these ideas a reality, perhaps we could become unstoppable!"

 ww1_gasmask_focus:0 "Chemical Warfare Focus"
 ww1_gasmask_focus_desc:0 "Some of our chemists have proposed the use of a new, incredibly deadly agent- poisonous gas, delivered by our artillery and trench mortars. Though chemical warfare has been frowned on for roughly a century, what choice do we have if we are to win the war? Beyond investing in these, it's also likely for the best to develop countermeasures quickly- it would be unfortunate for such an advancement to turn on us!"

If we focus our aviation efforts on the design and use of these aircraft, our nation's planes may one day flood the sky, destroying all enemy planes that even try to oppose them, which could provide a major advantage. Of course, the Bomber lobby has interesting proposals as well, so perhaps we should not put all of our eggs into one basket..."

Focusing our production and designers on this specific class of aircraft would be a good way to ensure that we can use the Air Force as a ground support tool, able to help the infantry gain ground by destroying enemy defenses and positions. Of course, fighters should still be produced, but these bombers may win us the war."

 ww1_airship_focus_desc:0 "The Balloon is our oldest aircraft, and experts are predicting that it may not have a long future on the battlefield. This is no excuse to ignore the designs of such craft, especially when they may still be an effective way to deliver large bomb payloads. By bringing out-of-work Zeppelin manufacturers under the state's wing, we could squeeze the most out of this design while we still can."

 ww1_aviation_effort_1:0 "Aviation Effort I" #Link me pls
 ww1_aviation_effort_1_desc:0 "Now that we have formally established an Air Force, we have made some interesting advances. Most notably, our aircraft designers have been proposing designs for specific roles, rather than simply arming generic models. Getting effective use out of these planes, designed with roles like attacking enemy aircraft or dropping bombs in mind, will require testing and research, but may prove beneficial."

 ww1_aviation_effort_2:0 "Aviation Effort II"
 ww1_aviation_effort_2_desc:0 "Our efforts to create aircraft roles have resulted in a variety of vastly different aircraft, which do vastly different things. The Fighter class of aircraft in particular has attracted a great amount of youth to aircraft, some of whom are quite adept already, who have some interesting ideas for the future of our air force. Perhaps we should gather some of their ideas, for the good of our doctrines."

 ww1_aviation_effort_3:0 "Aviation Effort III"
 ww1_aviation_effort_3_desc:0 "The development of the Synchronised MG has changed the rules of the Aircraft game. Fighters are now far more effective, Zeppelins might be seeing their last flights, and we need innovative thinkers to help keep us on pace with this development. If we become the master of this weapon, which will perhaps change the air war as much as ground war, we will be well on our way to Air Superiority."

 ww1_aviation_effort_4:0 "Aviation Effort IV"
 ww1_aviation_effort_4_desc:0 "Our Air Force, which was established only recently, has now integrated itself completely into our armed forces. This brings us the obvious benefit of a pool of aviation experts, as well as a new class of ''Ace'' pilots, who are even becoming minor celebrities.

 ww1_pilotformation_1_desc:0 "Currently, Aircraft fly solo- distant from each other, and engaging in one-on-one duels with any enemies they might encounter. However, with more and more machines in the sky, it's clear that this is no longer the most viable way to engage in air combat. Some of our physicists may be valuable in helping us to determine new formations for our pilots to use."

 ww1_pilotformation_2:0 "Pilot Formation II"
 ww1_pilotformation_2_desc:0 "The new formations we have established have indeed been a boon to us in combat. However, ensuring people stick to the formations is a different story entirely.

 ww1_aircraftprod_1:0 "Aircraft Production"
 ww1_aircraftprod_1_desc:0 "Though Engineers have been making aircraft for us loyally, it is simply time to introduce factories outright to the concept. Putting planes into mass production will help us flood the sky with friendly craft- and, more importantly, help us deprive our enemies of the same advantage. Who knows? Maybe some of these factory engineers may have some good ideas for aircraft designs..."

 ww1_aircraftprod_2:0 "Aircraft Production II"
 ww1_aircraftprod_2_desc:0 "While Aircraft have been produced at factories dedicated to vehicle production, specific manufacturies dedicated specifically to planes themselves have been established.

Some of our old airship bombers possess now essentially unused expertise, which could help the latter as time solves the former. By utilizing these men, we can ensure that the old lessons of bombing are not lost on newer craft."

 ww1_airbomb_2:0 "Air Bombing Effort II"
 ww1_airbomb_2_desc:0 "One of the biggest issues with our air force currently is the fact that bombing is, for the most part, a guessing game, with the required geometrical calculations simply not viable methods mid-flight. With not just doctrine, but also standardized equipment and training for its use, we can turn bombing from a mildly threatening game of chance to a precise and deadly science."

 ww1_air_innovation:0 "Air Innovation Focus"

From pilots down to the plane mechanics, it seems that everyone has something to improve and potentially offer, which we can use on a national level. Perhaps one day, Aircraft may be the most important weapon in war...nah, probably not."

 ww1_navalair:0 "Naval Bombing Effort"
 ww1_navalair_desc:0 "One of our aspiring, mid-level air officers recently displayed the conclusion of a project he had been working on in secret. A seaplane was launched from a static ship, dropped a bomb onto one of our old scrappers, sinking the poor old vessel. Though most of our high command was unimpressed, attention from the head of state could certainly give this ambition a boost."

Huge ships with equally large guns fighting at incredible engagement ranges is slated to be the order of the day. Due to this, a modernization program for our ships, as well as training in the new ways of warfare for our officers, is most certainly in order."

 ww1_newnavalcanons_1:0 "Naval Gun Effort"
 ww1_newnavalcanons_1_desc:0 "While our ship designs themselves are constantly evolving, we cannot forget about the guns aboard our vessels. Though we've been standardizing calibers for over a century now, we still have far too many different variable gun sizes for far too many roles. By cutting the total amount of standards, and making each type of gun more general-purpose, we can streamline ship design."

 ww1_newnavalcanons_2:0 "Naval Gun Effort II"
 ww1_newnavalcanons_2_desc:0 "Though we have now solved the problems of the guns themselves, we must also stay up to date with equipment that supports our naval batteries. Rangefinders are starting to become a common feature of our ships, and ensuring that our officers know how to use it, especially compared to our guns' maximum effective range, will make battling a much smoother process, and help us get more use out of our newer, better guns."

If our country is to stay relevant in today's naval war, we must bring out improved designs for these ships of our own."

 ww1_flexible_navy:0 "Flexible Navy"
 ww1_flexible_navy_desc:0 "A great mass of ships is of no use to us if they're only patrolling a very small amount of the ocean. Building a fleet which can go anywhere, any time it's needed, with large amounts of screens supported by decent numbers of Battleships and Dreadnoughts, could help us control more of the sea and respond to a larger variety of threats, allowing us to project power all across the world."

 ww1_large_navy:0 "Large Navy"
 ww1_large_navy_desc:0 "Having just Battleships and Dreadnoughts would be formidible on its own, but also creating a solid core of screens and battlecruisers can easily tip the seas in our favor from both the tactical options such crafts give us, as well as sheer number. If we build around this concept and study the doctrine to match, our fleet may just become unbeatable."

Serbia had promised the support for Essad Toptani, as well as financing his militia, at least until Albania is pacified and fully under his control. However, domestic analysts consider this as move of betrayal, as Serbia is still in most of Albania's eyes, considered an arch enemy, and even more moderate of them see this move as an attempt at occupation.

Upgrading these defenses will enhance our security capabilities, incorporating modern technology and strategic infrastructure to safeguard against contemporary threats."
 SAU_invest_in_city_merchants: "Support City Merchants"
 SAU_invest_in_city_merchants_desc: "The city merchants are likely among the wealthiest factions in the country. Therefore, it is crucial that we gain their support. To achieve this, we must offer them our backing and reduce government control over their activities. By doing so, we can secure their allegiance, which will, in turn, bolster the state and its economy."
 SAU_establish_millet_system: "Millet System"
 SAU_establish_millet_system_desc: "The Millet system, utilized in the Ottoman Empire, provided each religious group and sect with its own confessional court of law. These courts adhered to the specific laws of the respective religion or sect, such as Sharia for Muslims, Canon Law for Christians, and Halakha for Jews. This system allowed various religious communities to govern their own legal matters according to their unique traditions and beliefs."
 SAU_arable_land_development: "Arable Lands Development"
 SAU_arable_land_development_desc: "Instead of relying on food imports, a more sustainable approach would be to develop the arable lands across the Arabian Gulf, Red Sea, Ihsa'a, Qatif, and the pastures in Nejd. These regions hold significant agricultural potential. By leveraging imported modern technology, we can enhance the agricultural sector of our economy. This strategic initiative would mitigate the risk of food shortages stemming from diplomatic issues or low food storage, ensuring greater food security for our nation."
 SAU_develop_infrastructure: "Develop Infrastructure"
 SAU_develop_infrastructure_desc: "It is imperative that we begin investing in infrastructure by paving roads, erecting signage, and implementing sewage and water systems.

 SAU_establish_modern_schools: "Modern Schools"
 SAU_establish_modern_schools_desc: "Katateeb, while valuable for teaching basic literacy and religious knowledge, may no longer suffice as a comprehensive educational approach. While they impart skills in reading, writing, and the holy Quran, the breadth of knowledge in today's world extends far beyond these subjects.\nIt is crucial to include diverse disciplines such as mathematics, literature, and other sciences to provide children with a well-rounded education."
 SAU_Ihsaa_merchant_fleet: "Gulf Trade"
 SAU_Ihsaa_merchant_fleet_desc: "The Gulf Arabs, spanning from Basra and Kuwait to Trucial Oman to Arabestan, have engaged in trade with India and China for centuries, bringing exotic goods and significant wealth to the region.

 SAU_settle_tribes: "Settle Tribes"
 SAU_settle_tribes_desc: "Many tribes in our region sustain themselves through trading and desert agriculture, preferring a nomadic lifestyle over settling in.

Integrating tribes closer to urban centers facilitates better governance, promoting stability across the nation."
 SAU_aquire_modern_equipment: "Aquire Modern Tools"
 SAU_aquire_modern_equipment_desc: "Modern problems require modern solutions. By getting tools and techniques for construction and farming imported from Europe or Asia, we can boost the economy.

 #SAU_modern_taxes: "Modern Tax System"
 SAU_modern_taxes_desc: "Zakat, while important for welfare, it may not suffice as the sole economic engine for a modern, growing state.

Introducing taxes on properties, buildings, businesses, and trade can provide sustainable revenue streams."
 SAU_outlaw_slavery: "Outlaw Slavery"
 SAU_outlaw_slavery_desc: "Islam indeed emphasizes the humane treatment of slaves and advocates for their eventual emancipation. True adherence to Islamic teachings mandates that slaves be treated with dignity, provided adequate sustenance, and granted rights that ensure fair treatment and humane conditions. In Islamic practice, slaves are to be integrated into households, dining at the same table as their masters, and given the freedom to work when they want to."
 SAU_protect_caravan_merchants: "Protect Caravan Merchants"
 SAU_protect_caravan_merchants_desc: "Rather than supporting city and Gulf merchants, we could prioritize support for caravans passing through our domains. By imposing taxes, providing protection, and actively trading with these caravans—whether they are en route to or from Mecca, Yemen, or Ottoman territory—we can capitalize on the valuable goods they transport. This approach minimizes the need to engage in time-consuming trade activities in ports or cities."
 SAU_import_mesopotamia_food: "Import Basra Food"
 SAU_import_mesopotamia_food_desc: "Developing sustainable agriculture will take time. In the interim, relying on agricultural imports from Basra can help meet our food needs. This strategy allows us to prioritize long-term agricultural development while ensuring food security through dependable imports. Over time, as our domestic farming sector mature, we can gradually reduce reliance on external sources and achieve greater food self-sufficiency."
 SAU_northern_raids: "Raid the North"

 SAU_increase_slavery: "State Protected Slavery"
 SAU_increase_slavery_desc: "Despite Islam's clear stance against slavery, there are those who see it as a profitable option due to the availability of cheap labor for tasks like construction and farming, where workers are not paid. However, while it may appear that this practice contradicts ethical principles that islamic societies uphold it is economically advantageous."
 SAU_gather_support: "Gather Tribal Support"

 SAU_crackdown_on_christians: "Crackdown on Christians"
 SAU_crackdown_on_christians_desc: "Despite being People of the Book and warranting protection, Christians are still seen as polytheists, which is intolerable to Abdulaziz. Therefore, we should offer them the option to convert or leave. This approach aligns with Abdulaziz's unwavering stance on monotheism while also presenting a clear choice to the Christian population. It aims to maintain religious purity in the Saudi domains and ensure that Abdulaziz's principles are upheld. "
 SAU_support_katateeb: "Support Katateeb"

 SAU_reform_zakat: "Reform Zakat"
 SAU_reform_zakat_desc: "Zakat and Jizyah are not obsolete in this modern era; with a few reforms in their collection and allocation, they can be more effective than ever. These traditional forms of taxation offer a more compassionate approach compared to modern tax systems, which often lack flexibility and mercy. By modernizing the administration of Zakat and Jizyah, we can ensure that they meet contemporary economic needs while retaining their ethical foundations."
 SAU_establish_mabahith: "Establish the Mabahith"
 SAU_establish_mabahith_desc: "Every ruler and nation requires their own 'men in black' to safeguard state interests and conduct espionage on both enemies and allies. Intelligence agencies, such as the Mabahith (or intelligence agencies in English), are crucial for achieving this. These agencies function similarly to the Tsar's Okhrana, which played a pivotal role in maintaining the security and stability of the Russian throne. "
 SAU_Dynasty_Politics: "Dynasty Politics"
 SAU_Dynasty_Politics_desc: "Following the Araif revolt, many members of the Saudi dynasty have developed an interest in the state's politics. Within the dynasty, there is a divide: some members wish to maintain traditional ways, while others advocate for reform and modernization.

Navigating these dynamics will be crucial for the state's leadership as they strive to unify the nation and address the challenges of the modern world."
 SAU_Reform: "Reform the State"
 SAU_Reform_desc: "The Saudi state has historically been perceived as backward, fundamentalist, and somewhat terroristic, often despised and opposed by its neighbors, both small and large. Domestically, the situation is also problematic, as the state relies on outdated knowledge and practices from the 18th century. This must change. Saudi Arabia needs to transform into a beacon of modernity among the tribes and Peninsular Arabs, embracing the advancements and innovations of the 20th century. By adopting modern technologies, progressive policies, and comprehensive educational reforms, Saudi Arabia can position itself as a leading state in the region, fostering development, stability, and prosperity for its people."
