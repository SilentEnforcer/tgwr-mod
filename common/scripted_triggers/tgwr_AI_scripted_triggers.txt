# AI triggers
# By Rylock and Alpinia

### To have tags send volunteers whenever a war starts, add a new rule below
### ROOT is the tag sending the volunteers, FROM is the tag that receives them
### If the conditions are fulfilled, ROOT will automatically send volunteers to FROM whenever the latter is at war
### When adding new rules, please follow the order of triggers - first global (when the rule should apply), then FROM triggers (who should receive the volunteers), then ROOT triggers (who should send them)
